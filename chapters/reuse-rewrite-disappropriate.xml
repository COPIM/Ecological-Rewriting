  <title>Preface</title>
  <p>by Gabriela Méndez Cota</p>
  <p>From Mexico, where we live and work, we entrust you with a series
  of fragments, thoughts and stories hovering in the grey region between
  the singular, the academic, and the more-than-human aspects of reading
  and writing. Mediated by the teletechnological artifactuality of the
  COVID pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the fragments echo
  what Michael Marder and Anaïs Tondeur, inspired by Svetlana
  Alexievich’s <italic>Voices of Chernobyl</italic>, have in <italic>The
  Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> called an ‘exploded consciousness’. As
  committed readers of these two works<italic>,</italic> we set out to
  <italic>reuse</italic>, <italic>rewrite</italic> and
  <italic>disappropriate</italic> the second of them on the basis of a
  shared general question: what of the event named ‘Chernobyl’ remains
  to be witnessed in the material and imaginary space that we call
  ‘Mexico’? Both too much and too little, we thought. Too much, because
  the event of Chernobyl barely registered in the Mexican public sphere
  and still appears, in common sense, as unrelated to more familiar
  injuries of colonialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism and
  narco-state violence. Too little, because the significance of
  Chernobyl is, indeed, in some sense unrelated to human subjectivity.
  It is perhaps Chernobyl’s very indifference to the fact that most
  people in Mexico, as elsewhere, live their lives without remembering
  that they, like all forms of human or non-human life, were exposed to
  radiation, that struck us the most while reading <italic>The Chernobyl
  Herbarium</italic>. If a fundamental rethinking of the meaning of
  ‘Chernobyl’ has yet to take place against the dual backdrop of nuclear
  disaster and climate chaos – both driven, at least in part, by human
  hubris – our wager in this small book has been to bear witness, in a
  way informed by deconstructive and psychoanalytic trajectories of
  thinking, to a failure of representation that has always been there,
  unsettling the frames and scales of both academic and testimonial
  writing.</p>
  <p>COPIM’s call to reuse open access materials experimentally on the
  basis of a commitment to creativity, critique and justice, detonated a
  reflection about what ‘reuse’ would mean to those of us who usually
  think about our activities as professional knowledge production, and
  who live with an expectation to write specifically from what is called
  the ‘Global South’. Since COPIM did not establish in advance what
  ‘knowledge’ would mean in the context of this experiment, we initially
  set out to reuse and rewrite <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic>
  as a ‘situated’ response to that work’s treatment of existential
  questions. We soon realized, however, that given the project’s
  emphasis on the material and performative aspects of digitally
  mediated reading and writing, our task involved decisions that went
  beyond developing a ‘Mexican’ analysis of Chernobyl. Moreover, while
  the majority of us had a background in continental philosophy, we were
  already interested in exploring the channels of communication between
  disciplinary discourses and wider cultural practices in the context of
  an experimental research project entitled
  ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://filosofiadelapracticaeditorial.net/" xlink:title="null">Philosophy
  of Editorial Practice: Critical Perspectives on Open
  Access</ext-link>’ (Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de México,
  2019-2021). This meant that we had to perform our rewriting of
  <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic>,<italic> </italic>not just in
  terms of reusing its self-contained content or its aesthetic form, but
  in terms of making a critical intervention in the academic
  institution, too. Yet rather than being pre-planned as a critical
  programme, our articulation of a <italic>situated</italic> reuse and
  rewriting of <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> materialized
  gradually through the collaborative process of becoming experimental
  writers or ‘rewriters’. At the same time, while we may have decided
  not to apply any pre-given method or strategy of artistic disruption
  or critical appropriation to a work we had chosen because it invited
  us to attune affectively with the fundamental fragility of existence,
  we nevertheless tried to reuse and rewrite it in a way that conveyed
  our respect and appreciation for the work of the others involved.</p>
  <p>In <italic>Los muertos indóciles. Necroescrituras y
  desapropiación</italic>, the Mexican author and historian Cristina
  Rivera Garza points out that, like the practice of community,
  rewriting is about working with time to render something unfinished.
  If writing is ‘the basis of all practice of community’, one must
  conclude that community is always in/with time, always unfinished,
  always yet to be done
  (<xref alt="Rivera Garza 2019" rid="ref-rivera_garza_muertos_2019" ref-type="bibr">Rivera
  Garza 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the practice of community would be
  non-appropriative or, rather, ‘disappropiating’, an idea that can also
  be traced to Jean-Luc Nancy’s notion of ‘literary communism’. Nancy
  refers to writing as ‘the act that interrupts, with a single stroke –
  by an incision and/or an inscription – the shaping of the scene of
  myth’
  (<xref alt="Nancy 1991" rid="ref-nancy_literary_1991" ref-type="bibr">Nancy
  1991</xref>). The myth, in this case, is not merely that of individual
  genius or romantic authorship. It is the myth of identity as such,
  whether it takes a liberal or communitarian (or other) form. Beyond
  myth, something like ‘community’ would take place, but precisely ‘not
  in a work that would bring it to completion, even less in itself as
  work (family, people, church, nation, party, literature, philosophy),
  but in the unworking and as the unworking of all its works’
  (<xref alt="Nancy 1991" rid="ref-nancy_literary_1991" ref-type="bibr">Nancy
  1991</xref>). What Rivera Garza and Nancy suggested to us, then, was
  that the reuse of open access materials did not need to be thought as
  appropriation or reappropriation of ‘knowledge’. Instead, it could be
  thought as a creative exercise in ‘unworking’ or ‘disappropriating’
  which could creatively resonate-with (rather than conventionally
  represent) <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium’s</italic> invitation to
  think through (vegetal) exposure and fragility.</p>
  <p>It took us over a year, from mid-2020 until the end of 2021, to
  invent ourselves as a rewriting ‘community’. The process of doing so
  had several stages, from a reading group and a collective annotation
  of <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> on hypothes.is, through
  discussing ways of generating new content by means of associations and
  intertextuality, to drafting and commenting on individually authored
  pieces that allowed each rewriter to elaborate a singular engagement
  with Marder and Tondeur’s book. Each of the rewriters interpreted and
  elaborated the classic feminist notion of ‘situated knowledges’ in a
  singular way, without any clear and stable guidelines concerning
  knowledge, evaluation criteria or academic goals. We focused instead
  on reflecting how our spontaneous desire to collaborate or perform as
  a <italic>collective</italic> of creative rewriters could be reflected
  at the formal level, given both our interest in the practical,
  creative critique of institutions
  (<xref alt="Adema 2021" rid="ref-adema_living_2021" ref-type="bibr">Adema
  2021</xref>) and our basic-level prior engagement with the technical
  dimensions of design and publishing processes and platforms. In sum,
  we decided that we would not be appropriating a book but would be
  letting our schooled selves be re-written, rendered unfinished in
  creative fragmentation and montage, as a way of reusing the
  <italic>Herbarium’s</italic> invitation to think. The drafts offered
  by each rewriter were in the end fragmented, edited and re-edited as
  the best way of translating a series of individually authored chapters
  – which read, in Spanish, as more or less academic essays ‘about’
  <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> – into a dynamic set of
  fragments that attempt to <italic>repeat</italic>, in the
  Kierkegaardian sense of remembering forward, the latter’s style of
  assembling personal memories and meditations. While the technical
  point of fragmentation would be to facilitate mixture and non-linear
  reading possibilities on a processual publishing platform to be chosen
  and tested in the context of the COPIM project, the more conceptual or
  creative aspect of fragmentation referred to the poetic complexity of
  the assemblage process and the wider possibilities it allowed us to
  think, in practice, collectivity or community itself. Crucially, the
  fragmentation would not be reduced, for us, to a technical or merely
  aesthetic exercise. Rather it would make itself count as a collective
  effort to creatively disappropriate our own habits of writing and
  thinking as early career researchers.</p>
  <p>As Rivera Garza observes about the literary system, the problem
  with appropriative rewriting strategies such as sampling, re-mixing
  and plagiarising, is that they do not necessarily undermine
  conventional notions of liberal humanist authorship; more often they
  strengthen their hegemony. If at first the system reacts to them, over
  time it accommodates such appropriative strategies within the terms of
  the traditional conception of the individual author as genius: the
  Sampler, the Re-mixer, the Plagiarist as a gifted Artist. Instead of
  appropriating, or turning the alien into the proper, Rivera Garza
  invites us to ‘dis-appropriate’, to let the alien be. A poetics of
  disappropriation would seek to go beyond merely exhibiting the
  relational, time-based nature of writing as reading, and of reading as
  rewriting, however. It would also endeavour ‘to question the domain
  that makes a series of communal jobs appear as individual’
  (<xref alt="Rivera Garza 2019" rid="ref-rivera_garza_muertos_2019" ref-type="bibr">Rivera
  Garza 2019</xref>). Such is the academic domain as we know it, in
  which conventions and styles of writing often require the erasure of
  subjectivity, singularity and multiplicity, in favour of a clear line
  of argument expressed through a detached voice whose analytical style
  is orientated to an establishment of authority
  (<xref alt="Canagarajah 2002" rid="ref-canagarajah_geopolitics_2002" ref-type="bibr">Canagarajah
  2002</xref>). </p>
  <p>In certain contexts, academic conventions and impersonal writing
  styles can perform a critical function – with respect to the liberal
  humanist register of sentimental autobiography, for instance. In other
  contexts, though, a cultivation of testimonial writing can act
  critically as a form of resistance to ‘schooling the world out of
  existence’
  (<xref alt="Illich 1972" rid="ref-illich_deschooling_1972" ref-type="bibr">Illich
  1972</xref>) by means of abstract voices that compete for individual
  authority in a given disciplinary hierarchy. Aware of the gendered
  history of such abstract voices, we focused on rethinking – and
  therefore rewriting – our own education, material contexts, life
  experiences and political concerns, while simultaneously trying to
  attune to the memory of the unthinkable that Chernobyl has come to
  stand for. As a practical reference point we took inspiration from
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enbuscadelqueliteperdido.net/" xlink:title="null">an
  earlier, non-academic eco-artistic project around Mexican
  </ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enbuscadelqueliteperdido.net/" xlink:title="null"><italic>quelites</italic></ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enbuscadelqueliteperdido.net/" xlink:title="null">
  or edible weeds</ext-link> (2016-2016), which was itself inspired by
  the Open Humanities Press series <italic>Living Books About Life
  </italic>(2011), and which is described in one of the fragments that
  follow. As a theoretical reference point, our work echoed the
  tradition of blurring the boundaries between testimonial and
  philosophical writing as it took shape in the long aftermath of Latin
  American debates over the politics <italic>and</italic> infrapolitics
  (or deconstruction) of <italic>testimonio</italic>
  (<xref alt="n.d.a" rid="ref-nardxgnago4" ref-type="bibr">n.d.a</xref>).
  A thinking of existence beyond political demand that unfolds in the
  medium of deconstructive testimonial writing or ‘autography’, the
  infrapolitical turn became a key referent for the kind of exploration
  that rewriting came to involve for us. Once again: if a fundamental
  rethinking of the meaning of ‘Chernobyl’ has yet to take place against
  the dual backdrop of nuclear disaster and climate chaos – both driven,
  at least in part, by humanism – our wager in this small book has been
  to bear witness, in a necessarily singular way that nevertheless
  invokes specific philosophical and literary legacies, to a failure of
  representation that has always been there, unsettling the frames and
  scales of both academic and testimonial writing.</p>

  <p><italic>I walk along the train tracks. </italic>I do not know in
  advance how many kilometers tucked into the jungle are those material
  signs of the 19th-century Porfirian progress that waits to explode
  again like a nuclear bomb. Half of my heart vibrates with hope while
  the other half already presages the failure of our mission. Milo and I
  are with Eli and Beto in Hopelchén, Campeche, in Mexico’s Yucatan
  peninsula. We are part of the caravan that accompanies Marichuy, the
  spokesperson for the National Indigenous Council, to the territories
  fighting for their autonomy. We are gathering the signatures of voters
  so that those among ‘us’ who never had it, finally have a voice that
  represents them in the public space. For those already in power have
  announced that if their political party wins, there will be no future
  for the jungle. They will rehabilitate the tracks to re-run a tourist
  train that will supposedly detonate the region’s economy. Such a
  fantasy of a new economic miracle is dubbed <italic>El Tren
  Maya</italic> (The Mayan Train). Thinking of an event that has not
  stopped happening for five hundred years but has gone unnoticed after
  a such a long while, Milo renames it <italic>El Tren Maña</italic>
  (The Vicius Train).<italic> Between the metal and the wood grow all
  kinds of plants whose names I do not know. I step on them like the
  despicable human being that I am but they don’t die; they resist. In
  the summer, people try to clear the land, but after a few weeks with
  the help of Chaac the trees and weeds rise again from the ashes. Life
  is not true or false, it simply is and the jungle always shows it to
  me.</italic></p>

  <title><bold>Junkyard I</bold></title>
  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>It was January 1984. The National Nuclear Safety and Safeguards
  Commission<italic> </italic>found an abandoned van in the border city
  of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, which emitted high levels of radiation. The
  vehicle in question had been used as transport to sell, as scrap
  metal, what had once been a radiotherapy unit purchased by the
  Specialist Medical Centre. Since there had been no trained personnel
  to operate it, the unit had been left to rot. Recovered only to be
  abandoned again (this time at the Phoenix junkyard), the medical unit,
  disassembled into different pieces, had mixed the cobalt-60 granules
  that one of its now perforated cylinders contained with the rest of
  the metals that, day after day, trucks, cranes and other machinery
  would be responsible for discarding, removing and collecting. The now
  radioactive scrap metals would become rebar and construction material,
  exported and transported by other vehicles to the United States and
  the interior of Mexico to build the foundations of numerous houses and
  buildings
  ((<xref alt="n.d.b" rid="ref-n3ni2fg5fea" ref-type="bibr">n.d.b</xref>)).
  For a long time and without warning, radioactive energy would spread
  silently through Mexican and American territory, even more silently as
  would happen in the following years on the other side of the Atlantic
  after the Chernobyl accident,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://culturacolectiva.com/history/mexico-radioactive-milk-chernobyl/" xlink:title="null">from
  where radiation would again spread to the most unsuspected corners of

  <p>Laura and I had the following exchange several months after she
  first heard about the nuclear incident in Ciudad Juárez, México. The
  pandemic went on and we both tried to remain confident of the
  interiority of our homes versus the exteriority of the virus. Her
  immediate and spontaneous answers to my story and my questions
  resulted in various notes which I now regard as important topological
  coordinates of an invisible symptom. <italic>My dad died of cancer in
  2000 and something must have triggered his illness before that. There
  is no way of knowing if it is directly linked to Ciudad Juárez but his
  house was built in those years. Cancer is a disease that does not
  appear all of a sudden. It progresses silently. I have also thought
  about other possibilities. For example, I seem to remember that in
  1994 he was in Chiapas with Subcomandante Marcos. Over there, many
  people contracted </italic>Helicobacter pylori<italic>. A
  gastroenterologist said to me that it was common for people who had
  that bacterium to end up with cancer. My father had a test done and it
  came back positive. Although this sounds very far-fetched, I have also
  thought that contagion could have been on purpose, to infect the
  people who went to Chiapas. But he might have just as well gotten sick
  from chronic stress. He was an activist with the teachers and was
  involved in many confrontations with political groups. If they tell
  you ‘he had a heart attack because his body was unbalanced by stress’
  you say ‘yes, well yes’ … . Imagine a testing of the radioactivity of
  the houses that were built with those rods. That would give you some
  certainty, but we don’t even know where those rods went. What we need
  to know is the whole story, which nobody followed up. People in power
  have to hide it because they can’t look bad; they do everything before
  they lose control. Even if it’s loss of life, loss of any kind, they
  do everything to stay in power. If they are subordinates, then they do
  it so that those at the top don’t lose their jobs. And that happens
  all over the world. … There have already been accidents in previous
  years … can you imagine what could happen with nuclear energy?
  </italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juanico_disaster" xlink:title="null">San
  Juanico</ext-link><italic>, that’s the place where it happened also in
  1984. Just thinking that fast, we all know the danger of not disposing
  of alkaline batteries properly, so what? Most people still throw them
  in the trash can. After you told me about Ciudad Juárez, I remembered
  that there was a nuclear power plant in Veracruz, but I didn't know it
  was still operating, I only remembered its name:

  Mexican President Díaz Ordaz signed the authorisation to construct the
  Laguna Verde nuclear power plant. The construction began in 1976 in
  the municipality of Alto Lucero, Veracruz, after a territorial
  reorganisation that included expropriation threats and the acquisition
  of land from the inhabitants of the region by the Federal Electricity
  Commission
  (<xref alt="Balzaretti Camacho 2014" rid="ref-alejandra_oro_2014" ref-type="bibr">Balzaretti
  Camacho 2014</xref>). It was until the mid-1980s, however, that an
  organised anti-nuclear movement was formed in opposition to nuclear
  energy in Mexico. Between 1986 and 1988, there were blockades on the
  coastal highways of Veracruz, symbolic closures of the nuclear plant,
  a pilgrimage to the Basilica of Guadalupe, festivals, sit-ins,
  collection of signatures, concerted blackouts and ringing of bells,
  written interventions on electricity bills, and red ribbons on the
  doors of houses. The protests aimed to prevent the reactor from being
  loaded at Laguna Verde. To prevent the monster in the lagoon from
  waking up: <italic>There are Three Miles from Chernobyl to Laguna

  <p>by Xóchitl Arteaga Villamil</p>
  <p><italic>Sentipensar</italic> (thinking-feeling) emerges among
  actions, discourses and territories inhabited by multiple experiences.
  It is a proposal from the epistemologies of the South that creates and
  pays attention to experiences silenced by a univocal form of
  storytelling, namely Euroanglocentric academic norms. I do not claim
  that <italic>sentipensar</italic> merely inverts the hierarchical,
  universalist spirit, as well as the homogenizing eagerness of many
  academic ways of making sense of the world. I see it instead as an
  intermittent moment that summons us to mobilize from the multiple
  contributions that can add and coexist, with all their tensions, to
  the digestive issues that afflict us today:</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p><italic>… </italic>I read <bold>trauma as synonym for mental
    indigestion</bold>. And, on more than one occasion, I have proposed
    that art and <bold>certain kinds of thinking may contribute toward
    our becoming </bold>‘<bold>unstuck,</bold>’ obviously without
    changing anything in the physico-atomic reality of the half-lives

  (<xref alt="Haraway 2016" rid="ref-haraway_staying_2016" ref-type="bibr">Haraway

  of a damaged and ruined present
  (<xref alt="Tsing 2015" rid="ref-tsing_mushroom_2015" ref-type="bibr">Tsing

  concept that interweaves co/reasons, minds with bodies, natures with
  cultures, materialities with discourses. The territory and inhabitants
  of Chernobyl are an active memory that is materialized and actualized
  through this concrete rewriting, given that we collectively attempt to
  think-feel an event of the past through the ways in which we are
  disturbed by its resonances. <italic>Sentipensar</italic> is about
  unraveling … through the practice of storytelling, by exchanging
  stories with the <italic>Herbarium</italic> … that radiate the
  different ways in which the nuclear event continues on the narrative
  plane. However, the event does not belong to us, but rather belongs to
  a materiality that we regard as provisionally hospitable to
  collaborative intervention. We think-feel re-writing as a collective
  incarnation in texts, and it is precisely this plural task that
  indicates its disappropriation. </p>

    <p>Now that the creaking of the system is heard, we must continue to

  <p>There is a road. On the other side the cycads are resting. Yet it
  is not the cycads but the sleepy plants that appear to me first on the
  edge of that little path opening up between my grandparents’ house and
  the beach. Hidden among the low grasses that lead to the sea, the
  sleepy plants respond to the gentle call of my fingers. They are so
  close that I can talk to them with my touch. The cycads, on the other
  hand, live across the road, on the side of the bushes and the cows.
  Surrounded by footsteps and instruments that quantify their longevity
  and evaluate the possibility of their survival after a hypothetical
  forced transplant, the cycads, perhaps without realising it, continue
  their endothermic regulation and exude the fragrances that summon
  their pollinators. I play with the sleepyheads without noticing that a
  few kilometres to the south, a Canadian mining company starts the
  prospecting work to install an open-pit gold mine. Without noticing
  the steps, the instruments, the cycads, the pit, the
  <bold><italic>tepetatera</italic></bold><bold>,</bold> the leaching
  yard, and without realising that the pool where I play with my
  cousins, off the shores of the ‘El Farallón’ lagoon, belongs to the
  housing camp of Laguna Verde, Mexico’s only nuclear power plant, I
  strive to remain in my childish reverie: the ungraspable image of a
  wild mountain. <italic>There is an event going on, but I can’t reach
  it</italic>. There is an unnoticed geographical triangle that at that
  moment is being drawn: the sleepyheads and I in Boca de Ovejas, the
  instruments and the cycads on Cerro La Paila, the glow of
  radioactivity in Laguna Verde. There are countless physical processes
  that I do not perceive. The sleepyheads fold when touched by my hands,
  the wind, the noise. The agility of their movement is an acephalous
  response to the environment in which they are embedded. The technician
  writes in his report that the cycad community will not be harmed when
  mining work begins.</p>

  <p>I still remember the moment of leaving the house: the organisation
  of the backpack, the hurrying and shouting at anyone who, for whatever
  reason, took longer than expected, and then going on a long walk
  besides the Cuautla river, where we met its characteristic fragrance
  of ‘clean and fresh water,’ as we used to say. It was a kind of ritual
  set among a great diversity of plants, small crustaceans and fish,
  aquatic insects, stones and water running under an intense sun and a
  clear blue sky. It continued until the idea grew, among schoolmates,
  that the river was an exclusive concern of children. Adolescent life
  required other spaces and practices to be recognized, so visits to the
  river became less frequent. We stopped visiting the river with its
  vital smell and the sensation of cold water and stones on our feet
  became sporadic. Then student life caught up with me in Mexico City. I
  was barely out of my teens when I had a room in a boarding school and
  university responsibilities in the cold areas west of the megacity. I
  returned home, in Cuautla, every so often and only for a couple of
  days. I had no time to visit the fragrant river, but after some time I
  noticed how, little by little, between visits, its flow, vegetation
  and fauna were becoming smaller and smaller, as if the march of the
  population growth of that small city resulted in its reduction and
  deterioration. The world where I was a child no longer exists, and
  although I frequently return to that place trying to capture, even for
  specific moments and spaces, that smell of clean water, plants, stones
  and local aquatic fauna, I cannot find it either by smell or sight.

  <title><bold>Forgotten</bold></title>
  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>The time to come remains imperceptible, hidden, flowing in the
  shadows of oblivion. In Sarah Ruhl’s <italic>Eurydice</italic>
  (<xref alt="Ruhl 2008" rid="ref-ruhl_eurydice_2008" ref-type="bibr">Ruhl
  2008</xref>) the shadows that inhabit the underworld and make up the
  chorus of the play are actually living beings who plunged into the
  waters of the Lethes and turned into stones when they died. Since
  then, they feel neither sorry nor pity for anyone; they never laugh or
  sing. In fact, they feel nothing. Nor do they speak. They have
  forgotten all the things of the world. Their language is now the
  language of stones, the language of the dead, a silent language.
  Entering Chernobyl’s exclusion zone is like plunging into the Lethe.
  Pripyat, like the underworld, seems to be condemned, by its very
  nature, to human oblivion. However, compared with Orpheus, who
  descends into the underworld and makes the stones weep with his music,
  Marder and Tondeur’s work can be interpreted as the song that, rather
  than making the shadows weep, exposes their lament. Yet the deafening
  silence of Pripyat is not unique. We don’t know it, but there are many
  Chernobyls, just as every river, including the Lethe, has different
  courses which, without us realising it, often seep into the earth we
  walk on or evaporate into the air we breathe. How many Chernobyls,
  because they did not begin in a nuclear installation, have passed (or
  continue to pass) unnoticed, and remain forgotten? In how many walls
  built by contaminated rods do the waters of the Lethe not flow? The
  time of an event is interwoven from oblivion, and it only returns to
  show us in its ruins the passage of time.</p>

  <title><bold>Symptom</bold></title>
  <p>by Deni Garcíamoreno Becerril</p>
  <p>The concept of a <italic>symptom</italic> was popularised by the
  psychoanalytic tradition and it was in the second half of the 20th
  century that it leapt into the field of philosophy to refer to aspects
  from its critical and not only clinical figure. Within a critical
  grammar the symptom entails a temporal and spatial rupture that
  manifests a remoteness or an apparent material impossibility. For
  instance, the images in the <italic>Chernobyl Herbarium</italic>
  capture the nuclear <italic>radiation </italic>responsible for the
  catastrophe that took place there. Marder insists that despite the
  fact that the photographed plant does not contain the same amount of
  radiation that some plant specimen may have had at the time of the
  nuclear catastrophe, the <italic>explosions of light</italic> that
  reach to us now generate an immediate relationship with the
  catastrophic and nuclear spectrum that envelops the territory of the
  herbarium. Such a breaking of the book’s frame establishes a very
  particular temporal and spatial (im)possibility. In fact, the
  perception of Tondeur’s images generates a symptom that touches both
  the<italic> explosive</italic> representations of nuclear radiation
  and the bodily effects related to the <italic>invisible
  calamity</italic> of the nuclear catastrophe. Is it possible to
  generate a non-visual symptom, which starts from the memory of a taste
  or an image not necessarily produced technically and by light? The
  already well-known proposal of involuntary memory tells us yes: from
  tastes and smells it is possible to generate an involuntary or
  non-involuntary symptom that could take us back to another time that
  defies time and narrative conventions. Beyond these sensory
  possibilities, what happens when the symptom is not visible? What
  happens when it has not yet been activated?</p>

  <p>Milo is a true artist, one from the street. His poetic tool is not
  the image or light but sound; he is a musician. In his travels to the
  jungle he also learned to carve stone like the ancients. When I met
  him, he told me that someone revealed to him that the function of art
  for the Mayans had nothing to do with representation, but rather that
  the artist was ‘the bearer of time’. We liked going to the beach. We
  would swim out to sea until our feet did not touch the bottom. Then we
  would float on our backs and lose our eyes in the sky. One of those
  days we swam in a beach in which the oil residue, probably coming from
  the nearby wells, stuck to our skin. It was true, on this edge of
  history there was no virgin beauty; in every corner the kingdom of the
  non-living [evil] was already nesting. At dusk, with the feeling of
  witnessing the end of an era, with our palms and our voice we
  improvised some rhymes. We got a requiem. We did not know if it was
  for the inhabitants of that sea or for ourselves. It was the last time
  we swam together.</p>

  <p>Why were they meeting in late August 2020 to read and rewrite
  <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic>? Tired of the institutional
  culture of sacrificial bureaucratisation, competitive individualism,
  ‘publish or perish’ and other toxic fumes that left her breathless,
  one of them proposed to guide the others toward a different climactic
  zone where none of the hopeless fantasies prevalent in The University
  were likely to flourish. That first meeting, like those that were to
  follow (on Zoom for two years, now and then in the city of PubPub, and
  at a later point in the West Midlands region of a former member of the
  European Union), was an escape mandated by <italic>angst</italic> and
  co-sponsored by the Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for
  Monographs (COPIM) project. They would have to spend some time working
  with transplanted memory fragments on the outskirts of Global
  Knowledge Production, at the precise intersection between a massive
  forgetfulness and a large, attention-sucking technosphere.
  Fortunately, as Néstor Braunstein once assured her, attention could
  still be directed by more than the algorithm; it could also be
  summoned towards <italic>the word</italic> as an event that exceeds
  calculus
  (<xref alt="n.d.c" rid="ref-nkcis51zdfh" ref-type="bibr">n.d.c</xref>).
  In a roundabout way, they would insert themselves into the world of
  language at the time of its expropriation by the forces of
  hyper-industrialisation and a dangerously naive mistrust of thinking
  itself, which was as prevalent in Mexico as it was elsewhere in the
  West. In sum, they sought to escape from the technological domination
  of language that would make life unlivable. <italic>But the impression
  that one can flee from the calamity that is our civilization is no
  less immature than the sunny ideology of Knowledge Production
  itself</italic>. Was Michael Marder a genuine Author, the true
  originator of ‘his’ memories? As rewriters of Marder, did they aspire
  to be anything other than passive repeaters who first and foremost
  listened in awe? Should they seek recognition as ‘more’ than
  receivers, modulators, transmitters, remixers of <italic>The Chernobyl
  Herbarium</italic>? If their rewriting came to be regarded as
  ‘piracy’, would they not be pirating Marder’s piracy of Svetlana
  Alexievich’s <italic>Voices of Chernobyl</italic>, and in the process
  returning to that earlier work a degree of recognition for its
  diversity and for its attunement to biographies other than the
  Author’s own? Shall they not also claim Authorship within this
  extended effort at developing their own singular voice? There are no
  escape valves. By setting out to formally Reuse Open Access Material,
  they were speeding toward another, still greater catastrophe, spawned
  by the same total system: not ‘liberal humanism’ but the pernicious
  ubiquity of an instrumental revealing of Being that undercuts
  existence and prevails both in capitalist and anti-capitalist
  imaginaries. Still, for a while unworking freely, unafflicted by
  schooled writing, they spent the rest of 2020, and a part of 2021, on
  the shores of hypothes.is and HedgeDoc where, unbeknownst to some,
  they would still be receiving dangerous amounts of Knowledge from The
  University’s fallout. Insert references, provide information, explain

  Mexico did not need to declare it; we have been at war against drug
  trafficking since 2006, and since 2014 with the Ayotzinapa case, we
  know that selective disappearance is completely normal. Years of
  existing like this have shown me that life does not need Rule of Law
  to continue striving to preserve itself and that the economic system
  does not need justice to continue accumulating profits. Everything has
  changed without the rigidity of consciences daring to notice it,
  however life assumes the change and continues to strive to exist. It
  was in this effort to continue resisting death that – in the midst of
  a pandemic – I managed to recover what was left of my bike and the
  <italic>oregano orejón</italic>, the plant that, by dint of pure
  adaptation, grew at my departure at Milo’s house. Oregano came home to
  live with me. No one planted it, no one expected or wished for its
  presence and yet, even among the toxic concrete of the urbanization
  that had tried to eliminate the forest, and despite the shadow of the
  train tracks that the current administration threatens to reactivate,
  it planted itself into existence. Its usefulness to humans does not
  exhaust its meaning, but it is also true that it found it useful to
  clone itself. Chalo, the first thief of my bike, cloned it for his
  garden, and then I cloned it from that garden. Now that being exists
  at least three times. Solidarity also passes through utility. Among
  human beings, nothing is more useful to our lives than another human
  being; it is possible to extend this to non-human beings. The oregano
  is useful to me and we were useful to the oregano: <italic>In lak ech

  <p>From Walter Benjamin’s <italic>The Storyteller</italic>
  (<xref alt="Benjamin 2010" rid="ref-benjamin_narrador_2010" ref-type="bibr">Benjamin
  2010</xref>) one learns that some forms of human transmission are on
  their way to extinction. Oral narration and the very power of
  storytelling do not prevail in contemporary discursivity. It is, in
  fact, not only a matter of telling and recounting, but also and above
  all it is about listening. A listener pays attention. It may even be
  that he or she wants to keep the memory of the story and, in addition,
  unexpectedly or unconsciously receives the practical instruction to
  make knowledge known. If narration entails a tale, a story, a gesture
  of speech, this is so for the sake of the continuity of the life of
  others. Storytelling has an instructive purpose which is often coded.
  It implies a passage, a transmission. Yet the success of this
  transmission will be all the greater if its intention is not evident
  from the outset, but rather engages narration as the vehicle of
  mystery. This is quite different from data or information
  transmission, or from contemporary algorithmic classification.
  Generational transmission involves work with the story, including
  active listening and interpretation on the part of a receiver. It has
  a fragility and contingency that demands a work of relating and
  listening. Whenever I read <italic>Voices from Chernobyl</italic> I
  find that, instead, the text reads me. It mirrors me. It gives me the
  breath of life, shakes me and makes me uncomfortable. It takes away my
  tranquillity and my confidence in everyday life and in the apparent
  naturalness of my immediate surroundings, in the simplest and most
  unthought of my own actions, in their consequences. The chorus of
  voices, the stories, and Svetlana Alexievich’s way of listening and
  writing return to me a truth about myself and my own life: my finitude
  and at the same time my transcendence in the traces that my passage
  through the world will leave. Could one ignore the legacy of those
  voices, overlook their testimonies? How does one receive them? They
  shake my being in the world, both through what they say and what they
  cannot say. They stir up that which resists words and representation
  and all understanding. It becomes necessary for me to resist reading,
  to pause. I can only read from within a tension between not being able
  to continue and not being able not to. Following Benjamin and
  Alexievich, I would have liked to write a story about testifying to
  the reception and rewriting of <italic>The Chernobyl
  Herbarium</italic>, a life story that was not written for meaning,
  science, belief or as a purely aesthetic dissertation. A story that
  spoke to life about life. A text that quickly found its resonance in
  the one who receives and opens a letter. But I wasn’t able to. </p>

  <p><italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> proposes to ‘fight against
  nihilistic indifference’ ‘through a concerted effort of selecting,
  arranging, and displaying traces … as a commemoration and a warning’.
  Only in this way, by collecting and curating the ruins of the
  catastrophe, working from them and with their oblivion, will we be
  able to recognise the testimony of its history as well as its decay
  (or, in other words, to tell a story from its oblivion). Decades
  earlier, María Zambrano said that ruins were the object par excellence
  for thinking about history. For her, what is historical is not the
  facts summoned in the purity or integrity of their past; what is
  properly historical is ‘the vision of the facts in their survival, ...
  what has remained of them: their ruins. The ruins are the most living
  part of history, for only that which has survived its destruction
  lives historically’. If this is so, if ruins are those remains that
  survive the past, after the radioactive events of Chernobyl, México,
  Brazil and so many others, how can we think of all those bodies that
  resisted their own destruction? The (im)perishable state of the fallen
  trees in the Red Forest is proof of a life that survived its own
  cataclysm. However, it is clear that this fact is not yet sufficient
  to be able to fully affirm its ruinous character.</p>

  <p>Henry Ford in Brazil, an industrial colony in the Amazon, complete
  with golf courses? Of course, to anyone who does not have the full
  context of this Fordist utopia, the very idea will seem completely
  absurd. And they would not be wrong. There are many newspaper articles
  that tell of the process in which Henry Ford struck a deal with the
  Brazilian government to allow him to establish a small colony around a
  large rubber factory that carried with it the promise of
  industrialisation and economic stability for the region. At the same
  time, the project promised a throwback to the origins of the American
  countryside, where <italic>true American values</italic> were anchored

  years. At what point did Ford think it could work? Most likely at the
  time he made the decision he was clear-headed and informed by the
  economic estimate on which all his industrial and financial decisions
  were based. Surely the variable he cared most about controlling,
  because it could threaten Fordlandia to a large extent, was that of
  the <italic>human capital</italic> that would be pouring into the
  factory. In fact, there were several uprisings by the factory workers,
  but it was not until an infestation of the rubber trees generated by
  the vegetation itself that underpinned the abandonment and total

  <p>In a recent Instagram post from a popular bed &amp; breakfast
  located in the historic centre of the city of Oaxaca de Juárez, in
  Southern Mexico (where I was born and currently live) the phrase
  ‘Oaxaca is green’ appears below a series of photographs depicting
  green objects: some earthenware vessels, the city’s cantera streets
  and walls, the tiles in the bathrooms, the fountain in its courtyard,
  a very <italic>chic</italic> decorative installation of nopales with
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal" xlink:title="null"><italic>Grana
  cochinilla</italic></ext-link>, and plants and trees decorating the
  hotel’s colonial architecture. The post has some comments describing
  the beauty of the quarry that was used to build the hotel, formerly
  known as Verde Antequera and which has become one of the city’s most
  prominent tourist attractions in photographs and advertisements, the
  beauty of the plants and their characteristic glow. The green in these
  images is a desire, a fantasy constructed from scraps distributed at
  the speed of the Instagram algorithm. Oaxaca is not green, at least
  not in the sense that tourist fantasies suggest. In Mexico, water
  supply problems are mainly due to the failure of pipelines, which are
  obsolete, leaky and ageing, causing losses of up to 60% of the liquid.
  Oaxaca is no exception; it has gone from being the most biodiverse
  state in the country to seeing its natural resources diminished. Five
  years ago, water shortages occurred during the summer, when the heat
  wave painted the hills a deep golden colour. Nowadays, drought occurs
  every high holiday season, in the months of April, July, August,
  November and December. According to Los Servicios de Agua Potable y
  Alcantarillado de Oaxaca (SAPAO), in 2021 the metropolitan zone of
  Oaxaca suffered the greatest water shortage crisis in its history. The
  water, which comes almost entirely from wells and a spring in
  municipalities bordering the city,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imparcialoaxaca.mx/la-capital/530262/2021-el-ano-mas-critico-por-escasez-de-agua/" xlink:title="null">has
  even stopped supplying some areas</ext-link>. Having always lived in
  the historic centre, I am accustomed to storing water from time to
  time: a privileged situation compared to that in the peripheries and
  marginalised areas. With the commodification of everything, violent
  imaginaries appear about their bodies and trajectories. These become
  entangled with the environmental crises we are going through, the lack
  of green areas, the lack of water and pedestrian infrastructure, the
  lack of a territory that can be inhabited in more communal ways, more
  committed to life and space in common. … I don’t quite know what will

  to think that it will have similar problems to other cultural capitals
  in the world, or that it’s going to become just an Instagram stage.
  Maybe that is why I turn to people who approach environmental crises

  <italic>there</italic> we can find something that allow us to

  <title>In Uruk</title>
  <p>by Sandra Loyola Guízar</p>
  <p>The Poem of Gilgamesh was carved on tablets, in cuneiform script,
  about five thousand years ago. It now seems like a technology of
  eternal life, since it is writing that inaugurates human history as a
  quest for immortality. It is also no coincidence that it arose in
  Uruk, the first city in urban history. The poem recounts a journey in
  which King Gilgamesh loses the only plant that could give him
  immortality (it is stolen by a snake that rejuvenates by changing its
  skin). Defeated, the king returns to his city, Uruk. Upon arrival he
  recognizes that only the great wall that surrounds the city will
  survive him. Architecture and the city are also forms of writing and,
  as such, devices of immortality. In the 6th century A.D. writing was
  based on papyrus, but it was scarce because it was expensive and
  difficult to make. Writing materials were recycled: the paper was
  washed and written on again and again. The ink was scraped off with
  pumice stone and written over again. Such documents that retain barely
  visible traces of earlier writing on their surface were called
  palimpsests. Perhaps all cities are palimpsests that tell stories of
  destruction. The palimpsest of Mexico City has been written over and
  over, with viceregal buildings erected on top of pre-Hispanic
  buildings. Some elements of ancient Tenochtitlán’s layout remain to
  this day, like streets that were once irrigation ditches are gradually
  sinking, and buildings that move as if they were ships when the ground
  quakes. The city has been flooded for five hundred years because it
  was founded on a system of lakes whose water, which has been gradually
  erased, remains no longer as water but as sinking. Hence, in
  <italic>La ciudad: un palimpsesto</italic>, Guillermo Tovar de Teresa
  tells the story of the destruction of Mexico City and describes what
  still stands as that which remains to be destroyed:</p>
  <disp-quote>
    <p>The city that could not expand because of its lacustrine
    condition had to devour itself in order to grow. A church was
    demolished to build another on the same site ... Mexicans have the
    bad habit of self-devouring ... of building without destroying what
    already existed.
    (<xref alt="Tovar de Teresa 2006" rid="ref-tovar_de_teresa_ciudad_2006" ref-type="bibr">Tovar
    de Teresa 2006</xref>)</p>
  </disp-quote>
  <p>To settle implies to erase parts of the territory, any intervention
  preserves the traces of previous writings on its surface. Cities in
  general, but particularly Mexico City, are a recycled canvas where the
  urban layout, street names, some buildings and walls only exist as
  erasures of a past that is still inhabited and tacitly read. As King
  Gilgamesh also found out in Uruk, we inhabit a materiality that
  survives us. </p>

  <title><bold>The autophagic condition</bold></title>
  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>That Pripyat is a city frozen in time has become a shared belief,
  and it could not be otherwise. The truth, however, is that different
  forms of life have not ceased to sprout in the Zone; the only living
  entity that has been excluded is the human being. At any rate, this
  does not mean that the Zone suddenly banished the human from itself
  (as if expelling man from paradise once again, as many often claim);
  on the contrary, the alienation was and continues to be self-inflicted
  (<xref alt="M. Marder and Tondeur 2016" rid="ref-marder_chernobyl_2016" ref-type="bibr">M.
  Marder and Tondeur 2016</xref>). For this very reason, Marder proposes
  the syntagma <italic>alienation zone</italic> (used in Russia and
  Ukraine) as a more accurate description of what has happened there:
  the self-inflicted transformation of the human being into a stranger
  to the environment of which he was once a part. In turn, this is
  accompanied by a process of <italic>museification</italic> of the
  world in which experience, including temporal experience, has been
  annulled: we, being the excluded, the <italic>aliens </italic>of the
  medium, have been making the world a museum. As in a museum, the
  exclusion zone seems to be timeless; there ‘[i]t is still, and will
  remain, April 1986’
  (<xref alt="M. Marder and Tondeur 2016" rid="ref-marder_chernobyl_2016" ref-type="bibr">M.
  Marder and Tondeur 2016</xref>). Chernobyl ‘may not be a place at all,
  for its temporality and habitability have been irreparably
  interrupted’. Such a <italic>non-place</italic> thus confronts us with
  an existential enigma: ‘how does one pass through what does not pass,
  what does not become the past?’
  (<xref alt="M. Marder and Tondeur 2016" rid="ref-marder_chernobyl_2016" ref-type="bibr">M.
  Marder and Tondeur 2016</xref>). However, it is not so much that the
  world is a museum itself, but rather that it is a museum <italic>for
  us</italic>. If Chernobyl is a <italic>non-place</italic>, it is so
  insofar as we can only experience it, paradoxically, from the
  condition of the distancing and inaccessibility it represents for us.
  The same is true of our experience of time. If we feel that time does
  not pass, it is not because it does not pass, but because it is an
  imperceptible time for us (and not only imperceptible, but
  unthinkable: it is easier for our understanding to conceive the idea
  of an eternity than a time of billions of years). For that reason,
  Chernobyl is the scene of the unrepresentable. and that is why it
  becomes so complicated to think history from that <italic>non-place.
  </italic>Yet, it is false that Chernobyl is frozen in time, let alone
  in history. On the contrary, its way of existing and ‘surviving’,
  besides exhibiting our state of self-alienation, simply evidences the
  autophagic condition into which Western thought has sunk. In this
  sense, what really shocks us about a place like this is not so much
  the fact that it represents the petrification of a city through its
  devastation, but the fact that it is the devastation itself that is
  petrified for ‘us’.</p>

  <p>by Sandra Hernández Reyes</p>
  <p>When Cuautla was changing from being a rural to an urban town, Coca
  Cola installed a production plant on an important aquifer a few meters
  from the river, obviously without making public that the plant would
  be installed on important springs and that it would absorb thousands
  of liters of water daily. In exchange, the company promised to offer
  jobs and progress to the incipient city. Little by little, the
  enchanting metaphysics of capitalist modernity was taking shape. The
  industrial plant began occupying a small plot of land in a place
  called Manantiales and in a short period of time it reached the size
  of two enormous lots. The name of the place (‘Springs’) is not a
  metaphor, because from that place the water sprung at ground level,
  and together with the river and other water channels surrounded the
  city, supplying water to eighty percent of the total population of
  Cuautla. Today, almost three decades later, water shortages and
  contamination are part of the difficulties faced by several
  neighborhoods. Yet industries continued their arrival and it became
  more evident that that adolescent attitude of leaving behind nature
  and rivers to deal with a life more technophilic and fascinated by the
  aesthetics of asphalt was, in reality, a kind of spirit of the times,
  a metaphysics of which we teenagers were only depositaries and a
  reflection. The industries, it was said, did good to the small city by
  placing it on the road to development, leaving behind the countryside
  with its backwardness, its poverty, to offer jobs to thousands of
  people in technologically superior conditions. As an illusory
  metaphysics, progress never happened, not until now, but the dynamics
  of exploitation and extraction is maintained, extinguishing in its
  path everything that is useful for consumption, not only water, but
  all living things.</p>

  <p>According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Language, which belongs
  to the Royal Academy of Spain and has fixed and regulated the uses of
  the Spanish Language since 1713, one of the meanings of
  <italic>resistance</italic> is ‘the group of people who, clandestinely
  as a rule, violently oppose the invaders of a territory or a
  dictatorship’. What does it mean to <italic>resist</italic> in Mexican
  territory? In Ayutla, a <italic>Mixe</italic> community in the Sierra
  Norte of Oaxaca, people have not had access to water since 2017
  because its inhabitants were violently deprived of access to the
  Jënanyëëj spring, which supplies their drinking water.
  <italic>Mixe</italic> community governance regards the spring as an
  ecological site that in turn depends on a network of ritual meanings.
  In ‘Resistance. A Brief X-ray’ <italic>Mixe</italic> linguist and
  social justice activist Yásnaya Elena Aguilar Gil observes:
  ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.revistadelauniversidad.mx/articles/cf748d27-98bf-4e24-88d8-e044f004a422/la-prohibicion-de-la-vida-social" xlink:title="null">Resistance,
  whether we are proud or tired of it, shapes the relations and
  experiences of a world ordered by deeply intertwined, interlocking
  structures of oppression</ext-link>’. She emphasises the close
  interconnections between native languages, communities and
  territories. To exist from that place is to wage a war, to risk even
  the integrity of the body. Likewise, to exercise a voice that must be
  heard, a voice that in the case of the author is also enunciated from
  the collective. Languages cannot be thought of without those who speak
  them, just as they cannot be thought of without the ground on which
  they are spoken. For my part, I could not take part in this battle,
  but I do recognise that this is probably the consequence of a process
  of d<italic>eindigenisation</italic>, which is also the product of the
  consolidation of a mestizo identity.

  Aguilar Gil points out</ext-link>, that has formed part of the
  nationalist ideology of mestizaje, a mechanism of oppression by the
  Mexican state. When I say that I am Mexican and that in my family the
  Zapotec language was lost with my grandmother, and realize how
  recently I learned of this loss, as if the language had disappeared
  naturally, as something that was bound to happen and that was accepted
  with normality and distance. From Aguilar’s perspective, the
  disappearance of languages is neither a sudden nor a natural
  phenomenon, but rather the face of the Mexican state’s systematic
  violence against ‘speakers who have suffered discrimination for a long
  time’

  <title><bold>The other plant</bold></title>
  <p>by Sandra Hernández Reyes</p>
  <p>Leonardo Martínez and Graciela Tovar are a couple who arrived in
  Cuautla in the spring of 2013. They came from the southeastern state
  of Tabasco. Leonardo had been hired to work on the electric power
  megaproject called Proyecto Integral Morelos (PIM). Specifically, he
  would work on the construction site of the Morelos Aqueduct, which
  would supply treated water to the Huexca thermoelectric plant to cool
  its turbines. It was through conversations with Leonardo and his wife
  that I began to learn about what I had only heard about before;
  through them I understood that the thermoelectric plant implied a
  radical change in the way of life in the region. ‘You can’t lose it,’
  Leonardo told me, ‘if you follow the road to Oaxaca and have the
  panoramic Popocatepetl as a backdrop, you will find it’. The
  thermoelectric plant stands in the middle of a vast valley of
  farmland, generating a contrast that keeps it out of sync with its
  surroundings. The mismatch is not only visual. For the neighboring
  communities the industrial complex represents various affectations,
  mainly to health and to their livelihood, that is, to the field. At
  the end of 2011, the government of Felipe Calderón, through the
  parastatal Federal Electricity Company, announced the beginning of the
  PIM works, the main objective of this work was to satisfy the energy
  demand of the center of the country, but, above all, to supply the
  regional industrial zone led by the transnational Saint Gobain. To
  this end, they provided for the construction of two combined cycle
  thermoelectric plants, a 160 km gas pipeline and a 12 km aqueduct for
  water supply fed by wastewater that then flows into the Cuautla River.
  In the 520 pages of the study called <italic>Manifestación de Impacto
  Ambiental</italic> that the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones
  Nucleares prepared as a legal requirement for the construction of the
  thermoelectric plant, the existence and possible affectation of the
  collective rights over the waters of the Cuautla River is not
  contemplated, which reflects the null importance given to the social
  and cultural factors involved. The start-up of the thermoelectric
  plant represents the reduction of the river's flow, which will
  immediately impact a 10,300 hectare cultivation zone, directly
  affecting the right to food self-sufficiency and producing a drastic
  productive reconversion of the region. The thermoelectric plant would
  extract 245 liters per second from the Cuautla River, of which 60
  would be returned to the riverbed with an effective loss of 185 liters
  per second. The returned water, ‘dead water’ in the words of the
  farmers, includes thermal contaminants because the water is discharged
  at 40°C, seriously affecting aquatic organisms, plants, and
  animals.</p>
  <p>It didn’t take long for Leonardo and Graciela to adapt to the way
  of life in little Cuautla. He would arrive in the afternoons from
  working at ‘la termo’, as he called it, and after lunch he would go
  out with his wife to walk for a short time, taking advantage of the
  fact that the usual heat was diminishing and the wind was running a
  little cooler. He said that the afternoon wind helped him to relax
  after the always intense work days that most of the time took place
  under a scorching sun. It was on one of those walks that I was able to
  chat with them and we became friends. After two years of work,
  Leonardo began to worry that the work on the aqueduct would soon be
  finished and with it his job. Days went by and he had not found
  alternatives in Cuautla. So, with ‘la termo’ finished, Leonardo and
  Graciela left the city. A new stage was beginning: now the
  thermoelectric plant would produce energy and it seemed that the only
  thing left to do was to wait, as always, for the effects to be felt in
  the environment. In a way, the thermoelectric plant also stands as a
  symbol of our exclusionary civilizational paradigms, based on energy
  and the annihilating consumption of the world to obtain it. We have
  been educated and fascinated with technology that is powered by
  electricity without being aware of the consequences that this brings
  to our lives. We have unknowingly cultivated an extractive-destructive
  attitude towards the world, the same one that has placed us on the
  road to self-annihilation. </p>

  <p>Is there a link between <italic>gentrification</italic> and water
  scarcity? The displacement of the population due to the increase in
  rents and living costs derived from the commercial use of the historic
  centre of Oaxaca City goes hand in hand with the cultural policies of
  the state
  (<xref alt="De la Cruz Gallegos 2016" rid="ref-de_la_cruz_gallegos_gentrificacion_2016" ref-type="bibr">De
  la Cruz Gallegos 2016</xref>). This is part of a long process that
  stems from state development plans implemented throughout the 20th
  century. From the opening of the railway and the restoration of the
  temple of Santo Domingo de Guzmán in the Porfiriato, the first
  Guelaguetza in 1932, the professionalisation of tourism in the 1980s,
  the creation of the Oaxacan Institute of Cultures and the State
  Organisation of Artisan Producers of the state of Oaxaca, the
  construction of the tourist walkway in 1987, to the restoration and
  modernisation of some buildings in the 1990s, contemporary
  gentrification is accompanied by touristification, the design of the
  city for the enjoyment of tourism. In ‘The turistification of Oaxaca
  City’s historic centre’ professor Mabel Yescas Sánchez
  (<xref alt="Sánchez 2018" rid="ref-sanchez_touristification_2018" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez
  2018</xref>) points to a before and after the social crisis resulting
  from the conflict between Section 22 of the National Coordination of
  Education Workers (CNTE) and the government headed by Ulises Ruiz
  Ortiz (2004-2010). This change came about in terms of the direction
  that governor Gabino Cué Monteagudo (2020-2016) gave to the state’s
  cultural policies with the aim of cleaning up Oaxaca’s image,
  attracting tourism and investment, and generating economic spillovers.
  The projects of the Alfredo Harp Helú Foundation (FAHHO), which began
  to be generated on a large scale in 2007, are part of this new
  dynamic. I believe that both gentrification and touristification have
  contributed to water scarcity, via state policies that do not regulate
  and protect the territory and the life that takes place there, that
  allow the exploitation of natural and cultural resources for the
  benefit of the few. For example,

  <p>In 1986, the Grupo Antinuclear Madres Veracruzanas joined the
  anti-nuclear movement in Mexico. Caught up in the radioactive
  entanglement of the Chernobyl accident, implicated in more than one
  way in its trail of death, four women from Xalapa summoned thirty more
  women to demonstrate their opposition to Laguna Verde every Saturday
  at noon in the Plaza Lerdo for thirty years. Facing the federal
  government’s threats to apply physical and economic sanctions to those
  who engaged in protest actions such as blocking roads, a group of
  teachers, researchers, shopkeepers and housewives decided to stand in
  the same place week after week, arguing that they were, as women and
  mothers, <italic>the faction of the population that could still
  question the reasons for progress, science and technology at a time
  when we see our future threatened</italic>. Laguna Verde’s first
  reactor was started off in June 1990, after almost two decades of the
  plant’s construction. By 1989, fishermen near Laguna Verde had already
  denounced the discharge of radioactive water into a lagoon near the
  nuclear plant. More recently, physicist-mathematician Bernardo Salas,
  who investigates the dispersion of anthropogenic radionuclides, has
  found unstable atoms of cobalt-60 and caesium-137 in the waters of the
  Gulf of Mexico. This means that radioactive waste which has gone
  untreated for more than twenty years is present in the bodies of water
  that surround Laguna Verde
  (<xref alt="Salas Mar 2015" rid="ref-salas_mar_determination_2015" ref-type="bibr">Salas

  and are dumped on grasslands and animals, as Claudia Gutiérrez, the
  spokesperson for the Veracruz Mothers, asserts, these bodies, the
  grasslands and the animals, are not taken into account by the External
  Radiological Emergency Plan, which was designed by the Planning
  Committee for Radiological Emergencies in 1987. In the event of an
  ‘unlikely’ nuclear accident, the plan establishes an evacuation route
  for the (human) inhabitants of the region, as we read in a short
  booklet that also lists household resources that can be used to
  protect oneself against radiation: a handkerchief folded in 16 folds,
  a wet towel, a shelter made of bricks.</p>

  <title>What is a herbarium?</title>
  <p>by Gabriela Méndez Cota</p>
  <p>Nine years ago I co-authored an artistic cookbook,
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://enbuscadelqueliteperdido.net/" xlink:title="null"><italic>En
  busca del quelite perdido: recetario viviente para
  Cholula</italic></ext-link>, which invited readers on a stroll through
  Cholula’s streets, food and markets. As a narrative it sought help
  from vegetal metaphors and allegories, processes and phenomena, which
  contrast the cultural and political demands of various constituencies:
  from various generations of native inhabitants of Cholula, to expat
  academic communities who recently joined the former in their defence
  of sacred rural and urban spaces against expropriation by the state.
  While visual artists Ángela Arziniaga and Luz Elvira Torres made
  fantastic images of plant-human hybrids, I noted in an essay that an
  artistic cookbook is far from ‘a monumental contribution’ shedding
  light on ‘deep conceptual connections’. Our cookbook was traversed
  instead by a group of ‘family resemblances’ among weeds and/or among
  peoples. The aim was to undermine the smooth and translucent narrative
  of human sovereignty, with its insistence on the unity and stability
  of culture, and to replay its history of aspirations to the immutable
  through a procession of elusive beings, the ‘lost’ weeds or, in the
  indigenous language, Náhuatl: <italic>quelites</italic>. Upon
  encountering Marder and Tondeur’s herbarium, I immediately got an
  inkling of what that earlier project had yet to accomplish. It had yet
  to rewrite itself in conversation with others, and to take on
  shattered, shaken, damaged witnessing capacities in a time of
  ‘knowledge economies’. Like the plants it houses, an herbarium is
  essentially superficial, accentuating the shapes and colours of dry
  specimens – that is, surfaces refracting light. A rewritten herbarium
  is still a surface-to-surface encounter of imagination with alphabetic
  code. And it still seeks something of the curative force Marder has,
  perhaps a little hurriedly, identified as ‘the grace of art’. As he
  explains, such a force is powerless to effect a change in reality. But
  that powerlessness and desistence from depth are precisely its
  virtues. Is it possible to be touched without a modicum of
  sentimentality?</p>

  <p>Plant metaphors are not new to Western thought. In fact, according
  to ecofeminist philosopher Alicia H. Puleo, the surrealists used
  vegetal metaphors for the feminine-infantile-sensitive. There is a
  sinister danger in any metaphor which denies the potency of childhood,
  women, and the plant kingdom. The <italic>femme-enfant</italic> of the
  surrealists sustains a dangerous hierarchy. In contrast to this
  conception of the vegetal, I always like to remember carnivorous
  plants, who developed this crude adaptation mechanism to obtain
  nitrogen in poor and swampy lands. No, there is no virgin beauty. Nor
  is there innocence in the plant world. The beautiful lilies can also
  be pests that threaten the life of other species such as in the Lake

  <title><bold>The volcano</bold></title>
  <p>by Sandra Hernández Reyes</p>
  <p>The thawing of the Popocatépetl glaciers feeds the enormous pine
  trees that surround this volcano and climb its slopes. In turn, these
  waters feed small local streams, several intermittent and subway
  rivers that hydrate life as they flow throughout the region. This is
  one of the reasons why the volcano has been worshipped for centuries
  and is still considered a deity by the locals today. I think about
  this while I am on my way to Cuautla from Mexico City, I also think
  about the fact that a short time ago I did not take into account that
  my route is similar to that of the aquifers that flow into the Cuautla
  River, partially fed by the thaws of Popocatépetl that give it both
  mineral wealth and the low temperature characteristic of its course.
  There is a silent relationship that runs and establishes itself under
  my feet, extending to Cuautla and then to all of southern Morelos
  until it reaches the Amacuzac River. The multiple links between the
  volcano and the river allow for the abundance of plants that grow wild
  around the riverbed, but also plants such as <italic>Nastortium
  officinale</italic> or watercress, cultivated on the banks of the
  river in small artisanal dams. Other branches of the river carry water
  for hundreds of local nurseries that grow floral and tropical plants,
  other lands grow Galdiolus or Gladiola and some still grow cereals and
  sugar cane (<italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic>). The economic
  importance of the plants in the Cuautla region means that they are
  cared for and cultivated, turned into merchandise and inserted into
  the commercial circuit, thus, inscribed in the logic of profit, their
  growers do not take into account the care of water resources or the
  condition of the growing scarcity of water for the inhabitants of the
  region. Greenhouses are located in greater numbers in some areas of
  the city and grow plants of all kinds, from orchids to palms,
  flowering plants, tropical climate fruit trees and temperate and even
  cold climate plants. They regularly occupy large plots of land, since,
  like agriculture, their production depends on the available land.
  These businesses dedicated to the cultivation and distribution of
  plants require large amounts of water to irrigate the plants; this has
  caused the surrounding residential areas to face water shortages.
  Although there are many neighborhoods where water is totally lacking
  one or two days a week, in the Casasano neighborhood it is
  commonplace. Current living conditions have created a metaphysics of
  independence from nature, producing a blind faith in the relationships
  that make possible the accumulation of capital. Hence, none of the
  associations of farmers or nurseries have been concerned about
  maintaining the integrity of the river or the springs that are
  neglected on the margins of the city and within it with significant
  accumulation of garbage and dirt of different types. In spite of
  everything and although the river is not visible in all the spaces of
  Cuautla, the plants are the most visible part of the presence of the
  river in the region, there is a deep and silent relationship with the
  river that links the life of the families of the region, the
  industrial activity and the plant life, an important network of silent
  relationships that pass through culture and nutrition, although our
  conscience formed in capitalism has not yet understood them.</p>

  <p>At the end of the 17th century, it was not uncommon to find men who
  suddenly fell ill while travelling far away from their countries. In
  the French language this condition was usually referred to as
  <italic>mal du pays</italic> until the physician Johannes Hofer
  proposed a new concept that managed to more accurately explain the
  phenomenon, namely: <italic>nostalgia</italic>. From the Greek νόστος
  (returning home) and ἄλγος (pain), nostalgia became the term of choice
  to describe a feeling of estrangement and non-belonging, a suffering
  that came with being away from a past that men recognised as a place
  of happiness and refuge, usually their place of origin or homeland.
  Some of the medical treatments that achieved a certain degree of
  success consisted simply in returning home or, if this was not
  possible, in engaging in remembrance exercises of the past that the
  sick person so longed for
  (<xref alt="n.d.d" rid="ref-nsfdzyqm1ss" ref-type="bibr">n.d.d</xref>).
  Three centuries later, things have changed dramatically. As in the
  17th century, we suffer from a loss, but unlike then, it does not seem
  that the  solution could lie in the recovery (real or symbolic) of the
  place of origin. The remedy prescribed for our time would rather have
  to consist in a flight, because the place of origin, or indeed the
  past, has become a hostile presence that makes us ill. What shall we
  call this new illness produced no longer by the remoteness and
  separation from that origin and that past, but by their presence? What
  name shall we give to this ailment that arises when the environment in
  which we are immersed suddenly becomes a strange and hostile world? In
  any case, no matter where we go, it does not seem that flight is
  viable enough. The past casts its shadow on a future that proves
  equally hostile.</p>

  <p>A group of armed police and military personnel sit outside the
  municipal palace of Actopan, Veracruz. Inside, representatives of
  Goldgroup Mining Inc. detail the procedures that will be carried out
  once the extraction phase of mining begins on Cerro La Paila. In
  techno-scientific language, mine employees claim that the
  environmental damage will be minimal, that cyanide leaching will be
  harmless because it <italic>is like dissolving a Coca-Cola in a vat of
  water</italic><sup><bold><italic>
  </italic></bold></sup>(<xref alt="n.d.e" rid="ref-npqiwufwp17" ref-type="bibr">n.d.e</xref>),
  that any earthquakes caused by mining will be of barely one degree on
  the Richter scale, that hurricanes, winds, the proximity to Laguna
  Verde, are all environmentalists’ tales. They do not say that the head
  of the mountain will be sliced off, that gold will be extracted from
  its entrails to the point of exhaustion. They don’t say it in these
  words because any allusion to the mountain as a living entity, on whom
  a pit of explosives will be forcibly imposed, could awaken the still
  vivid memory of the imposition of Laguna Verde a few decades ago.
  Someone, to calm things down, sketches the project's perimeter on a
  flipchart and tries to convince the inhabitants that the impacts, if
  any, will be contained, delimited, within this very small piece of the
  mountain, which is also almost pure grassland. But someone else
  replies that since the drilling began, the
  <bold><italic>aguajes</italic></bold> have dried up, and calls into
  question the very notion of delimitation. The mine rumbles the
  mountain. Plant life, the animals, the rocks, they are all choked off.
  The chemical stridency of the mine can be heard in the bodies of those
  who can imagine the infiltration of cyanide, sulphuric acid and other
  heavy metals into the aquifers that flow down to the coast. The mine
  is not just the open pit on the mountain. The mine is downstream. The
  mine is the acid runoff that flows down to the mangroves. The mine is
  what opens the bodies to an unfathomable vulnerability<sup>

  <p>by Etelvina Bernal Méndez</p>
  <p>‘How fine it would be, Agathon’, said Socrates in <italic>The
  Symposium</italic>
  (<xref alt="Platón 2005" rid="ref-platon_dialogos_2005" ref-type="bibr">Platón
  2005</xref>) ‘if wisdom were a sort of thing that could flow out of
  the one of us who is fuller into him who is emptier, by our mere
  contact with each other, as water will flow through wool from the
  fuller cup into the emptier’. In <italic>Voices from
  Chernobyl</italic>, it becomes clear that we are not free, independent
  and autonomous particles, but clearly subjects that depend on each
  other. All of us, on everything. But what forms of relationship does
  interdependence produce, and is interdependence the same at all times
  and in all places? Alexiévich calls each story in her book a
  monologue, and each title in itself is a poem. Each voice brings a
  legacy, a lesson, a wound and a consolation, as well as a lot of
  questions. The stories are monologues that, nevertheless, emerge from
  a dialogue. She comes to listen to the witnesses, to the survivors of
  Chernobyl, for whom Chernobyl is a crucial signifier in their lives.
  Her own witnessing presence is not omitted from the stories. As the
  survivors address words, doubts, complaints, and grievances to her,
  she receives and holds them without erecting them as a monument to
  pain. Instead, she allows the stories to transcend her as an
  interlocutor; she passes them on to others in a graceful gesture of
  reflection and, in doing so, makes witnesses of all of us. ‘What to
  bear witness to, the present or the future?’, asks Alexievich in the
  interview with herself at the beginning of her book. Thirteen years
  have passed since I first read that question, and its sharpness still
  resonates strongly. It is not easy to understand. Its sonority,
  attractive and powerful, reveals itself as the posing of an enigma.
  Something that eludes discernment from the experience of things. A
  paradox, a witness of the future? It seems absurd. In a certain
  temporal logic, and in a certain conception of human consciousness,
  testimony would be the full word of the witness, the confirmation
  before others of what has happened, of <italic>what has already
  happened</italic>. How, then, could one give a testimonial account of
  what is yet to happen? Perhaps precisely to the extent that we
  recognise that it is not so much consciousness that provides this
  knowledge, but precisely that which is of the order of the
  unconscious. The transfer of an experience from one generation to
  another requires deciphering. It is veiled, even if it is evident. The
  knowledge of truth, or the knowledge that matters most to the desiring
  subject is that which comes in the form of an enigma and displays at
  the outset what is not understood: the illegible, the diffuse, the
  edges of the story, that which explodes the conscience and makes it
  burn with questions and reflections: Why, and how did this happen? If
  we can know anything at all about truth, it is through work with the
  enigma. This work does not take place by contiguity, simple contact,
  conversation or coexistence between two people. Instead, it is about
  the practice of cuts and the introduction of certain punctuations.
  This is an art, more akin to craftsmanship than to industrial
  production. It takes time and style. I am interested in Alexievich’s
  way of editing testimonies, insofar as it does not conform to
  journalistic, historical, political or even literary or aesthetic
  registers. She keeps the pen and the tension in the chiaroscuro of
  discourse, in a grey zone. She accentuates twists, links that are at
  once subtle and exposed and not immediately clear to the human
  conscience, revealing that nothing is merely alien and everything is
  at stake. In a tragicomic juncture, one of her voices says: ‘What to
  talk about, death or love, or is it the same?’ Such a literary
  delivery is something other than mere transcription or full reportage.
  Svetlana’s <italic>rewriting </italic>of the testimonies gives an
  account of the unconscious. It bears witness to it. Hence the renewed
  strength of legibility that it brings. No attempt is made to cover it
  with new false veils that presume completeness. The manner and style
  of its stories cannot be capitalised on. They keep open the lid of the
  reactor, the astonishment, the exploded consciousness. Resisting
  comprehension, the stories urge a collective work of reading,
  listening and rewriting. <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> can
  be read as a continuation of the editing/rewriting device that is
  opened by <italic>Voices from Chernobyl</italic>: a device for memory
  transmission, for listening and paying attention to the consequences
  omitted from the immediacy of consciousness, the ear or the eye. It is
  a way of drawing attention to the omitted history, to the suffering of
  the people, to the silent (or silenced) testimony of the plants, to
  the recognition of exposure without escape. </p>

  <p>In their preservation and isolation we discover an appropriation
  that inscribes in the ruins a crime against history. While the
  abandonment of the ruins in the world, to which they belong and which
  they compose and decompose by their mere presence, shows us the
  historical course (simply and plainly what happens in time, with that
  precise impersonal character that denotes not what one has done but
  what has been done), their isolation from the world reveals an attempt
  to take possession of time and history, to become its author. Nothing
  could be more contradictory, because one seeks to author what one does
  not own and because, in the eagerness to preserve the ruins as
  monuments that worship the past, the horizons that show us the passage
  of time are closed off. This is what we have called, like many others,
  <italic>museification</italic>. The museification of the ruins thus
  translates into an attempt to annul the past and to conceal the
  future; in other words, as an attempt to interdict the possibility of
  temporal experience: the only thing that is experienced there is an
  <italic>eternal present</italic> (so that the past only functions as
  the sum of all the accumulated facts that justify the present and the
  future is no longer the announcement of the futurity of the
  (im)possible but the confirmation – known or unknown – of the
  present). Contrary to what is often believed, what the museum exhibits
  in the preservation of ruins is not history, but its dispossession.
  But, moreover, the ruins torn from their own worldliness also announce
  the withdrawal of life. We wondered, then, what was happening in the
  exclusion zone so that the life that inhabits it could not finish
  dying. What must be understood here is that to kill is not to give
  death, but to take it away: the dispossession of life is at the same
  time the dispossession of death.</p>

  <p>The house I lived in with Milo is near the train tracks. I remember
  the times when the train woke us up and we had to wait an eternity for
  its furious metallic sound to pass and we could get to rest again. It
  happened once a month, and yet feeling close to the metal beast
  shaking the earth and air was violent. Its transit was infrequent
  because it did not transport people but oil oil extracted from the
  depths of the sea, which also spills and intoxicates the water. Oil is
  our post-revolutionary fetish for economic development in Mexico.
  Today, even with everything we know about the dangers of continuing to
  exploit this mineral, the public administration continues to insist
  that it is our only source of wealth. When the train tracks are
  rehabilitated and tourist traffic becomes heavier, and all sentient
  beings suffer even more from their transit, the progressive nightmare
  will be fueled with oil. … When I had a job I spent my salary on
  gasoline: I am a normal sinner. Later, I could no longer consume oil
  and my only option for mobility was reduced to using my own metabolic
  energy, which sadly also needs me to devour other living beings to
  obtain it. Violence is one of the edges that make up the horizon of
  reality. I don’t think there is any sin-free energy. The question for

  <p>In the thickness of our present there is the ubiquity of plastic: a

  mouth wraps, face masks, intubation material for those whose breaths
  escape from them. Anything with plastic packaging that was consumed 30
  years ago or more is slowly disintegrating into microplastics,

  <p>Every time a plastic disintegrates, it releases chemical substances

  that can be mistaken for food by marine species, or easily assimilated
  due to their tiny size, and can also enter the metabolisms of
  terrestrial living beings. The presence and decomposition of
  micro/plastics and their additives haunt, for instance, the breeding

  plastic from food. The challenge of <italic>staying with the

  route of total cancellation of plastics while problematising the ways

  <title>The ruins of history </title>
  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>Faced with the undeniable problem of the world’s uninhabitability,
  the calls for an ecological conscience that manages to reconcile and
  care for its environment are abundant. The problem is that,
  ultimately, they remain rooted in a nostalgic notion of pristine
  Nature that must be recovered if we are to ensure our own salvation.
  Hence, most such calls are incapable of thinking about future modes of
  existence, for they remain anchored in an idea of survival that is
  understood simply as the continuity and extension of our present. It
  is not surprising, then, that faith in instrumental reason finds its
  reaffirmation as the only one capable of guaranteeing the ideal of
  self-preservation and durability through the administration of life
  (and salvation). But it is not the ‘end of the world’ that lies in
  wait for us; the post-apocalyptic future we have been dreaming of for
  so long has already reached us, it is already here. Baudrillard knew
  this very well and had a point when he wrote that ‘our epoch no longer
  produces ruins and vestiges, but only waste and residues’
  (<xref alt="Baudrillard 2006" rid="ref-baudrillard_ilusion_2006" ref-type="bibr">Baudrillard
  2006</xref>). But does this mass production of waste really mean that
  we can no longer speak of ruins, that their appearance is now an
  impossibility and therefore we can only speak of them with nostalgia
  as when we speak of a lost and distant object, typical of mythical
  times? If for so long it has been asserted that ruins are the object
  par excellence for thinking about history, what does this imply for
  our understanding of history and, more specifically, for historical
  work? Have we reached a point where we can no longer speak of history?
  There are thus two options: either we abandon the idea of ruin once
  and for all, or we end up recognising its historical (conceptual)
  transformation so that we begin to conceive of debris as the new mode
  of appearance of ruins. In either case, what this would mean is that
  history, far from continuing with its monumentalising trade, must now
  concern itself with its residues, with making a mythopoetics that
  makes it visible and makes its history visible. Making history of the
  present means, at present, making history of our waste. After all, it
  is the waste that shows us the ruins of the future, they are the
  window to a future in ruins.</p>

  <title>San Lorenzo</title>
  <p>by Yareni Monteón</p>
  <p>The first time I went out with Milo, it was to the hotel at Playa
  San Lorenzo, an abandoned construction that was the product of the
  diversion of public funds by El Negro Sansores (governor of the state
  of Campeche in the sixties, and father of the current governor) and
  was left unfinished. Back in the days of El Negro Sansores, the dream
  of progress was to turn each beach into a tourist amusement park so
  that foreigners with money could spend the morning disturbing turtles,
  sponges and starfish with their jet skis; in the afternoon they would
  receive a relaxing massage from some exotic amerindian beauty – who
  would surely look just like me – in exchange for a paltry tip, so that
  finally at night and under the dim light of the moon their body
  excretions could be spilled to the place where the shoals rested the
  fatigue of the day. Fortunately for the vegetal and marine beings of
  San Lorenzo, those pestilent businesses did not turn out well and the
  dream of progress did not come true. The hotel was transformed into a
  surreal garden in which jungle trees, weeds of all kinds, cacti and
  wild magueys occupied the most luxurious rooms. Only plants, some
  non-human animals and intrepid vagabonds dared to inhabit, not because
  the concrete was more fertile than the land that had been taken from
  them or was not toxic, but because those who felt they owned it had
  failed. </p>

  existence – is infinite. However I do not fool myslef, their return is
  not a definitive triumph, because the Maña Train – which is propelled

  <p>The images that make up Melanie Smith’s <italic>Fordlandia</italic>
  create a contrast between the forms of life that have reclaimed space
  in the ruins of Ford’s industrial colony. The water tank that supplied
  the space reserved for the Americans, and various vestiges of machines
  are all ruins in which the last thing to disappear will be the legend
  <italic>Made in USA</italic>. For a few minutes, in the first (night)
  scene, we hear the crickets <italic>crunching</italic>, the chirping
  of birds, the shrieks of monkeys, the breeze dissolving in the trees.
  A reptile cuts this repetitive, circular sequence by plunging
  violently into the water, in an abrupt splash that breaks with the
  <italic>ambient sound</italic>. The third shot is the shadow of the
  plane carrying Fordlandia. The auditory element is retained, but it
  changes category: we now hear the loud turbines filtering through the
  plane’s wobbling metal structure. … Perhaps recapturing the vegetal in
  <italic>Fordlandia</italic> was not Melanie Smith’s main motivation.
  Despite the hierarchy of tensions between sound/animal image and
  motorised, industrial sound/image, the material aspects of the
  recovered image give an account of the vegetal that rebels even in the
  peacefulness of movement and from the background that they constitute
  in relation to the animal. For the rest, the video shows only one
  image that explicitly refers to the <italic>vegetal setback</italic>
  that the Fordist colony encountered. This image is also mediated by
  animal sound, but it is the first one that gives a panoramic view of
  the vegetation in the foreground and sends part of the ruins of the
  Ford factory into the third plane. In addition to the perspective, the
  variable colour is something that gives a specific indication to this
  image. It is clear that some kind of filter or modification of the
  film on which it was shot is present. The sequence that begins at
  10:39 invites speculation that it may have been shot on 35mm or 16mm
  film, as opposed to the other sequences that were clearly shot on
  digital film. There are two possibilities: either a filter is present
  that specifically modifies the greens, or they are using a
  <italic>lomochrome</italic> that changes the values of the colour
  gamut and again changes the greens to purple. In fact, the ambient
  sound is replaced by a destabilising movement of the shot, which also
  contrasts with the perfectly framed background in the previous
  sequences. The purple is not present in absolutely all the greens
  (which would make us think that perhaps it is a filter made in
  post-production, but which also wanted to make the digital element
  invisible), but it begins to acquire more strength as we go deeper
  into the shots, as the plants get closer and envelop the industrial
  structure. We could say that there are two noises that make a symptom
  in the image: the visual and the auditory, and the differential of the
  image with respect to the other sequences is the visual one. The green
  is purified to distinguish it from the photoreception of the peaceful
  green. The unruly and revolted green is shown to us through an
  inversion of the visible values. The green that triumphed over
  concrete and steel, and subverted the illusion of flight.</p>

  that is geographically and historically close to Xochimilco – in which
  he documented the autonomous initiative by neighbors to obtain
  bioenergy from agricultural waste that was produced in their

  at the end of that senseless decade that Milo was orphaned. When he
  was eighteen years old, the Law granted him the right to dispose of
  his diminished patrimony. What he did with it was what any other
  nineties teenager of that age would have done with a few thousand
  devalued Mexican pesos at his beck and call: he bought an old van,
  called his friend Isaac – another orphan – and the two set off on an
  adventure towards the Chiapas jungle, a place that over some years of
  coexistence was revealing its mysteries to them. They first reached
  Palenque and later they reached San Cristóbal. They were never hungry
  or helpless. The environment that adopted them vibrated with renewed
  airs that blew from the autonomous territories. When I was born the
  Berlin Wall no longer existed, for my fourth birthday the Zapatista
  Army of National Liberation (EZLN) rose up in arms and declared war
  against the Mexican State and denounced the evils of capitalist

  think, what they register in their materiality, which is already
  enfolded in the nuclear infrastructure: a lagoon and an unstable atom,
  a grassland and a steel structure, the inhabitant of an

  them ‘biocultural and archaeobotanical heritage’, threatened
  ‘biodiversity’. On La Paila, there could be individuals as old as 2500
  years: living fossils: plant relicts from the Palaeozoic era. To think
  like a cycad is to germinate crouched among the rocks of the mountains
  where they were displaced, to retreat into mineral sanctuaries, to
  weave themselves into a precarious entanglement. Cycads interpret the

  <p>It may seem that what happened in Ciudad Juárez in 1984 was an
  exceptional case, a product of bad luck. It is hard to believe that
  such a thing could happen again, except that it did so three years
  later under almost the same circumstances in Goiânia, Brazil. Again,
  two rubbish collectors entered an abandoned hospital and found a
  machine, which they dismantled and subsequently sold to a scrap yard.
  After a few days, the owner of the depot noticed something that caught
  his attention: in the newly purchased machine there was a capsule from
  which emanated a blue glow, a kind of powder or stones that, he
  thought, could be very valuable. He decided to extract the contents,
  to take it home and share it with some of his friends and family. What
  happened next is already clear: several people were sick and five
  victims died from the radiation. Panic-stricken, many of the
  inhabitants of Goiânia opposed to the burial of dead within the area,
  fearing that their bodies posed a danger, even though they had been
  decontaminated and buried in lead coffins. They saw each body as a
  threat, as a ‘radioactive battery’. Their efforts, in any case, were
  futile: the burials took place and the graves were sealed with
  concrete. Fear, on the other hand, did not cease, but spread /even
  further. Local commerce declined, as no one wanted to risk buying
  contaminated food or objects. Several inhabitants decided to leave the

  <p>It is incredibly difficult to talk and write about rewriting. No
  serious book on the subject has been able to avoid the task of
  thinking about the conditions of possibility of rewriting in proximity
  to the scene of academic capitalism. Still, before commencing, a work
  on rewriting must first decide how to broach a theme that incessantly
  reverts to the unthematisable. As we have seen, <italic>the very
  structure of witnessing breaks down where the event, with all its
  extraordinary, groundbreaking and death-bearing potential, merges with
  everyday life thanks to its imperceptibility</italic>. What is there
  to say about exposure to rewriting that cannot be seen nor smelled nor
  heard nor touched nor tasted? Those of us who have been in its eerie
  neighborhood have resembled objects, onto which certain effects have
  been inflicted, as opposed to subjects aware and in control of what is
  going on. Bypassing our consciousness, <italic>The Chernobyl

  <p>I have two recurring dreams. The first is when I walk along the
  train tracks to get to the Hotel San Lorenzo, the second is when I
  dream of the San Román cemetery. San Román is the oldest cemetery in
  the city of Campeche, Mexico. It was built at the end of the 18th
  century. The only plant beings that inhabit it permanently are six
  huge trees that I suspect have been there since 1700 or earlier.
  Everything else is white bones and white marble. After centuries, few
  sprouts of life make their way through the lapidary ideology of modern
  eternity: in the 18th century, society wanted to make sure that the
  dead stayed dead - that vampires did not return from the grave - just
  as they wanted to make sure that the radiation, well enclosed in its
  sarcophagus, did not return to suck the life out of us. This dream by
  contrast almost always leads me to remember the cemetery of Amecameca
  and its cheerful pumpkin. The orange flower-covered tomb blurs the
  line between life and death. The final judgment and the resurrection
  are not in the future: mercy is conjugated in present. </p>

  <p>Playa San Lorenzo and Lake Xochimilco are located in two different
  Mexican states or provinces – Campeche and Mexico City, respectively.
  For me, their bond is both physical and psychic. Physical because
  during my first years of life I fed on vegetables grown in the
  chinampas of Lake Xochimilco, which in turn  fed from the black waters
  of the lake contaminated by sewage from the City. And then, in later
  years, I was able to move, feed and swim in a sea also polluted by
  sewage from the city and tourist activity as well as oil extraction.
  Psychic because when I imagine the water cycle, I see the polluted
  water of the lake next to which I grew up raining on the sea. Fresh
  water and salt water: the same polluted water only in different

  <p>A distinctive feature of ruins is that they function as sacred
  places, since they ‘incarnate the inexorable link between life and
  death; <italic>the downfall of what man has proudly edified</italic>,
  already defeated, and the survival of that which he could not achieve
  in the construction’
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2020" rid="ref-zambrano_hombre_2020" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2020</xref>). So, where are the ruins or the testimonies of what has
  happened, and what are the ruins or the testimonies of what has
  happened? Can we recognise the ruins of history only in the demolished
  works of human endeavour? By resorting to a metaphorical use of
  edification, Zambrano not only restricts to a very limited group the
  set of objects that we can consider as historical, for she excludes
  from this category everything that is not the product of human labour.
  At the same time she seems to end up reaffirming an apparently
  incontestable hierarchy between the <italic>human world</italic> and
  the <italic>natural world</italic> that distinguishes modern thought.
  Thus, for example, she will go so far as to say that, just as
  ‘building is a triumph of man over nature, so too is history’
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2020" rid="ref-zambrano_hombre_2020" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2020</xref>). The plant life that sprouts freely among the ruins
  (symbol of pure life and its transforming power) is, in turn, the sign
  of the sinking of history into nature, and a symbol of ‘the peaceful
  revenge of the humiliated earth’
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2020" rid="ref-zambrano_hombre_2020" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2020</xref>). The plant life that springs from the margins and chinks
  of the ruins represents – if we follow Zambrano's assumptions – a
  process of inversion and superimposition in the relationship between
  history and nature. Over time, all construction (including history
  itself) will irresistibly bend to the force of nature. The natural, in
  turn, will function as that force that demands its own redemption and
  the restitution of its sacredness. If vegetation is a symbol of pure
  life and transforming force, it is because it is a life that is born
  of death, of the dejection and destruction of what humans have built,
  thus liberating nature from the force that once claimed to subdue it
  (hence its appearance is interpreted as the moment of revelation of
  the sacred). From this perspective, it would seem then that
  <italic>ruin</italic>, understood as binding (or rather as
  <italic>religare</italic>), would be nothing other than the
  possibility of peaceful reconciliation between the human world and the
  natural world that restores a certain original state previously lost:
  that of the <italic>humiliated earth</italic>. Zambrano’s romantic
  vision of nature is, on this point, undeniable. A nostalgic tone can
  be perceived in the reflections she devoted to thinking about nature,
  plants and the earth. However, if we point out these limits, it is not
  in order to generate a hasty judgement that simplifies what has been
  expressed. On the contrary, they are the starting point to begin to
  generate a deeper reflection that foregrounds certain aporias and
  fundamental questions regarding the ruinous character of human works
  and their function.</p>

  <p>What would happen if ten centuries or ten thousand years from now,
  humans or other species decided to dig or do archaeological work and
  unearth the entrails of our ‘excrement’ stored in concrete-covered
  sarcophagi? This question, which has preoccupied researchers since the
  1980s, raises a problem of nuclear semiotics. How do we convey a
  message of radioactive danger buried deep in specific areas of the
  Earth? What signals are needed for the potential inhabitants of the
  human and non-human future? How can we ensure that they understand our
  messages of danger from the past? It is also a design problem that the
  Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) has been trying to solve since 1983
  for the geologic nuclear repository of tunnels and caverns, built more
  than 600 meters deep in the Yucca Mountain Desert, New Mexico, where
  the U.S. military’s most hazardous nuclear waste is located. This is
  one of the first geological repositories of nuclear waste, which will
  be filled in a couple of decades and sealed with concrete. A
  monumental ‘Do Not Enter’ sign will be installed and another one
  buried at 20 feet. The WIPP has involved linguists, archaeologists,
  anthropologists, engineers, psychologists and science fiction writers
  to try to determine an alarm system capable of being understood in the
  future. More or less naive or absurd pictograms, iconograms,
  architecture for current storage facilities with specific typologies,
  among other ideas, more or less naive or absurd. New warehouses of
  this type are planned for the coming decades. In Mexico, some waste is
  managed through the Patrader Radioactive Waste Treatment Plant,
  located at the Nabor Carrillo Flores Nuclear Center in the State of
  Mexico. There are other centers: the Radioactive Waste Storage Center
  (Cader), the Radioactive Waste Laboratory, La Piedrera, which stores
  rod contaminated with Co-60 and the Peña Blanca area, where uranium
  tailings produced at the Villa Aldama uranium plant were transferred.
  These ‘nuclear graveyards’ exist in many countries for substances
  whose hazardousness will begin to decline in 300 years or so. Yet the
  figures on this subject have such large margins of error that it is
  almost absurd to bother to think about them. Since the experience with
  this type of energy is not more than a century old, all projections
  are illogical and worryingly approximate. In recent news, the piling
  up of untreated polluting waste at the Laguna Verde nuclear power
  plant was denounced. Compacted in black drums and yellow bags, piled
  up, sometimes carried from one place to another, and buried in
  warehouses, something comes and goes that will not degrade but
  continues to accumulate.</p>

  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>We live in an age whose production processes have accelerated so
  much that there is little point in talking about the duration of
  things, because things simply no longer last, or last less and less.
  Duration has become a concept with little or no meaning.
  Paradoxically, the times of the most accelerated production and
  innovation are, at the same time, the times of the longest lasting
  waste. For example, the ‘half-life’ of cobalt-60 (i.e. the time it
  takes for its radioactivity to halve and transform into another
  element) is 5.27 years, caesium-137 is 30 years, and uranium-238 is
  4.5 billion years. The biggest problem is that the current
  repositories for nuclear waste serve only as temporary storage
  facilities, since, in addition to the fact that their capacity is not
  infinite, they cannot be considered as places that can guarantee a
  totally safe safeguard to contain the risks posed by such waste

  When we think about the junk and waste that is gradually taking over
  the world, it becomes very difficult not to be attracted by
  Baudrillard’s statement that ‘our age no longer produces ruins and
  vestiges, only waste and residues’
  (<xref alt="Baudrillard 2006" rid="ref-baudrillard_ilusion_2006" ref-type="bibr">Baudrillard
  2006</xref>). How can we even speak of the ‘ruins of history’ when all
  there is is debris (which only announces and confirms the gradual
  emptying of historical experience)? One must note, however, that
  Baudrillard’s words conceal an important bias, which resonates with
  Goethe. Goethe once wrote: ‘America, you are better off than our
  Continent, the Old. You possess neither ruined castles nor basalts.
  Neither sterile remembrance nor useless strife disturbs your inner
  life today’
  (<xref alt="Waldheim 1950" rid="ref-waldheim_ideologipolitica_1950" ref-type="bibr">Waldheim
  1950</xref>). For Goethe, America could not have ruins, for it had no
  history. Baudrillard starts from a similar assumption: the absence of
  ruins is the absence of history. The difference between the two
  thinkers lies in the fact that, for Goethe, the absence of ruins
  translated into the hope for a second beginning and a new edifying
  project: that of a ‘New World’. For Baudrillard, on the other hand,
  the absence of ruins is rather the symptom of a hopeless epoch that is
  built on voids incapable of evoking its history, and instead only
  exposes the current banal state in which human edification finds
  itself. Despite their difference, are not both perspectives
  underwitten by a same monumentalised and monumentalising vision? It
  seems that ruins can gonly be conceived of as the representation of
  what was once a monument, while the debris is merely the waste left
  over from man’s edifying work. Indeed, Baudrillard situates ‘ruins’ as
  ontologically opposed to waste and debris. Lacking in historical
  value, scrap is the abject, the ugly, that which exposes our misery,
  that which is not worth looking at, and, for that very reason, that
  which is best hidden. And yet we must not lose sight of the fact that
  a ruin, after all, is only a ruin in retrospect, that is, it is never
  a ruin in our present, but will be a ruin with the passage of time (it
  <italic>will be</italic> when it <italic>has passed</italic>). In this
  sense, debris is the only remnant, the only one that resists and
  rebels against the obligatory demand for acceleration of our
  times.</p>

  Viruses are strange beings and ancient inhabitants of the Earth.
  Strange because they have surprising capacities to intertwine with all

  living beings. Rather they are remnants, fragments that deceive and
  sneak into the interior of micro/organisms, causing a diversity of
  alterations in them. The immensity and flexibility of viruses make
  them the most replicative and abundant entities on the planet, the
  vast majority of which swim in oceanic waters, making up 94% of all
  DNA contained in the seas. In turn, some 1031 virions, i.e. the
  morphologically active and infectious particles that bind to and
  invade all living beings, dance around the world. These millions of
  reactive virions are made up of fragments of some nucleic acid, plus
  layers of protective lipid molecules and some (glyco)proteins that are
  the lure to invade host cells. Each virion particle shares this
  biomolecular morphological pattern; if the fragment is DNA it will be
  an adenovirus, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), and if it is RNA it
  will be a retrovirus, such as tobacco mosaic virus, SARS-CoV-2 or
  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We are talking about minute
  particles that collectively dance in and around micro/organisms, as
  well as in a variety of ecosystems; beings that are reactive elements
  and ancestral terrestrial inhabitants that have millenary experience
  of adaptation to a myriad of circumstances.</p>

  diversity of bugs and disintegrating creatures (archaea, bacteria,
  nematodes, annelids, fungal mycelia, etc.), the soil’s nutrient supply
  is gradually depleted. In addition, under the radioactive influx, the
  communities of micro/organisms that are part of and form the soil,
  i.e. the creatures that carry out the flows of matter and energy in
  any ecosystem, are unable to reincorporate organic plant matter, e.g.
  tree trunks, causing them to undergo a certain process of temporary
  suspension, an encapsulation that slows down or makes impossible the
  continuity of their life and death processes. Communities of
  microorganisms made up of viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi and other
  small eukaryotes thrive in many ecosystem patches. Particular
  microbiomes emerge, for example, from the diverse communities of
  creatures that inhabit our skin, eyelashes or intestines. Within this
  diversity, the virome is the viral portion of the microbiome, where

  <p>Existing repositories for nuclear waste serve only as temporary
  storage facilities, because, in addition to the fact that their
  capacity is not infinite, they cannot guarantee to contain the risks
  posed by such waste. That is why, for some years now, the construction
  of ‘deep geological repositories’ has been undertaken in order to
  remove these wastes from the unstable Earth’s surface by burying and
  enclosing them in the geological depths for thousands of years in
  order to minimise the danger they pose. These constructions, if
  successful, would be a feat, as they would finally realise the dream
  of erecting a building capable of withstanding and even defeating the
  passage of time. However, the realisation of this dream is nothing
  more than a utopia that only reveals the biases of the times. One of
  the greatest challenges would be to ensure that these constructions
  remained undisturbed and impervious to all outside contact and events.
  How would it be possible to keep a building – even an underground one
  – unalterable, as if whatever happened around it did not affect it, as
  if it were not part of the world of which it is in fact a part of? The
  Sarcophagus, the steel and concrete structure that was built to cover
  the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, was supposed to shelter and confine the
  dangerous radioactive material inside, so that everything on the
  outside could feel safe. However, its construction proved to be more
  of a desperate (and failed) attempt to maintain a clear distinction
  between <italic>inside</italic> and <italic>outside</italic> (and, in
  turn, to make it possible to control and manage the space). What the
  Sarcophagus does is not actually neutralise the effects of radiation,
  but simply hides them. Its construction is a staging of the
  <italic>inside-outside</italic> that seeks to provide a (false) sense
  of security to the viewer from the ‘outside’. But the truth is that
  there is no outside: we inhabit these residues, we are part of the
  Sarcophagus

  <p>I find a gesture of genuine transmission, if I may put it that way,
  in the voices that Svetlana Alexievich brings us through her
  listening, writing and editing. I also find an urgency of transmission
  about Chernobyl and its consequences in <italic>The Chernobyl
  Herbarium </italic>by Michel Marder and Anaïs Tondeur. In both cases,
  there is a refusal to serve as a document for Science or for History.
  Yet, for whom are the prayers, the voices, the reflective fragments,
  the chronicles of the future, the samples of the invisible mark of
  radiation addressed? Are those books ... for <italic>us</italic>, for
  <italic>our</italic> children? For consciousness? For the soul? For
  human life? Are they a nod to the missing subject, to the divided
  selves? For me, <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> is the effect
  of a received transmission that at the same time is relaunched,
  dispersed, and blown to others. Not only the contaminating
  radionuclides are dispersed, displaced, but also the voices, the
  plants, the reflective fragments of Chernobyl, the words and the
  suspense reach us. How should we look at them, receive them, and
  realise that something of unthinkable proportions, has indeed
  happened? Neither as a witness nor as a victim, but as a mere
  earthling passing through this world, I was a distant recipient of
  Chernobyl at the age of six. I remember asking my father around that
  time if he thought we would ever be so many people in the world that
  we wouldn’t have more than a square metre of space for each other. He
  said yes, maybe, but he would probably be three metres below the earth
  by then. Thus he informed me of two things: that someday he would die,
  and that someday things on the planet might turn topsy-turvy. He
  stated very clearly that there were tragedies and misfortunes, that he
  would not witness them all <italic>and</italic> that he would not be
  there to protect us in the future. My dad died 20 years and one day
  after the Chernobyl explosion, on 27 April 2006, just before a wave of
  severe flooding in Tabasco
  (<xref alt="Bernal 2021" rid="ref-bernal_inundacion_2021" ref-type="bibr">Bernal
  2021</xref>), and long before the COVID-19 pandemic. But I am no
  stranger to any of these events, because I grew up with the awareness
  that something serious could happen collectively at any moment. At any
  rate my dad seemed to know that dying was necessary. What, in fact,
  could he care about Life? He was surprised that his own father, at the
  age of 80-something, still cared enough to go to the dentist. 89 years
  old at the time, he was a very old man still concerned about the
  future of the world: he worried, for example, that there would be a
  revolution in the wake of the contested 2006 presidential election. At
  the same time, he believed that it was fine to bury rubbish, because
  that fertilised the soil. He didn’t foresee the current excess of
  plastics and packaging. <bold><italic>I can see that the difficulty of
  speaking led Marder to give voice to the plants, and Svetlana to the
  survivors, and me to intervene in their words by degrading,
  decomposing, dislocating and blurring the centre in order to perhaps
  approach the truth as Bracha Ettinger does with the photographs, to be
  able to work with them by blurring the images. To use another register

  <title><bold>An atomic priesthood</bold></title>
  <p>by Sandra Loyola Guízar</p>
  <p>The way energy is produced today confronts us with the questions of
  how to design urban-architectural projects at the temporal and spatial
  scales of planetary catastrophe, how to isolate them from the
  curiosity of humans or species that do not yet exist or how to convey
  the message of danger.<bold> </bold>In 1982 the journal
  <italic>Zeitschrift für Semiotik</italic> issued a survey that posed
  the following question: ‘How would it be possible to inform our
  descendants over the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and
  dangers of radioactive waste?’ Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed the
  creation of an atomic priesthood, thinking that the Church and its
  belief system has been successfully handed down for almost two
  thousand years. This priesthood would be dedicated to preserving
  knowledge about the location and dangers of radioactive waste through
  rituals and myths, and would indicate forbidden areas and consequences
  for disobedience. Another proposal was made by Françoise Bastille and
  Paulo Fabri, who proposed genetically intervening cats to
  significantly change color when near radioactive material. They called
  this The Ray Cat Solution.  Another idea was that of Vilmos Voigt:
  install warning signs in many languages and, from time to time, add
  new signs with translations, without removing the previous ones. The
  sign we use to indicate the presence of nuclear radiation, the black
  clover, or rather, the circle with three blades representing the three
  types of radiation: alpha, beta and gamma, is more or less recent. It
  was invented in 1946 at the Radiation Department of the University of
  Berkeley. At the beginning it had light blue and violet colors, then
  it was modified because they considered that these were not associated
  with the danger they wished to communicate. Then it became the current
  combination of yellow with black, although in the emoticons of some of
  our cell phones it is orange with white. This symbol may be familiar
  to us, but according to surveys it seems that only 6% of the world’s
  population knows what it means. Efforts have been made to design a
  clearer symbol to transmit the danger, even to settle them in the
  waste deposits projected for this century. Currently, the shamrock has
  been taken up again and a skull and a human silhouette running in a
  red triangle have been added. However, there are discussions about the
  cultural variables of the typology of the skull because there are
  countries that relate it to themes unrelated to danger or to other
  ways of understanding death, such as the repeated use in Mexico of
  skulls that are celebrated and have their own festivity. The effects
  of nuclear energy and its waste are universal, but the message that
  needs to be communicated faces cultural heterogeneity and a planetary
  communication problem that, in addition to the anthropocentric
  intention of designing a signal, excludes the problem of animals and
  plants that also suffer the consequences of radiation and who should
  be warned of the imminent danger. Storing nuclear waste confronts us
  with the present and future human otherness, but also, and absolutely
  not disputed, with non-human otherness, because so far it is not
  evident how vital it is to be able to communicate in the present (and
  in the future) between species.</p>

  <p>by Sandra Hernández Reyes</p>
  <p>I walk downstream until I come upon the huge <italic>amate</italic>
  trees that have guarded La Mora (a waterspring) for thousands of
  years. I choose this place to take some pictures because I love the
  green carpet made of creepers, fig trees, and countless plants. The
  union of the waterspring with the river provides enough nutrients for
  the exponential growth of vegetal life. This includes the watercress,
  an aquatic plant that was cultivated in Cuautla for the first time
  just 75 years ago, and then taken to various sections of the Cuautla
  river where artisanal dams were built. The watercress became food for
  the aquatic fauna, especially for the <italic>acociles</italic>
  (<italic>Cambarellus montezumae</italic>), an endemic type of
  crustacean, usually small and gray in color. Decades ago, when its
  population was still visible in the waters of the river,
  <italic>acociles</italic> prevented the watercress from becoming a
  pest that could cover dozens of meters in just weeks. At that time
  there was a large number of birds, eagles, herons, some owls, and
  small birds of various types and colors that made the vegetation on
  the banks of the habitat, feeding largely on the
  <italic>acociles</italic> that were then enough food to promote an
  ecosystem. Some watercress growers harvest the mature plant and make
  packages immediately to distribute them commercially; others are
  responsible for taking care of the growth of young plants. For this
  they pour various chemical components between the dams, and spray as
  many on the foliage of the plant. The purpose, they explain, is to
  kill the pests that threaten their growth. They say that, from the
  first shoots, some organisms such as insects and crustaceans, among
  them <italic>acociles, </italic>threaten their existence and their
  ideal (commercial) size. Their efforts to eliminate the crustaceans
  has led to their de facto extinction. In addition the chemicals dumped
  in the river have also other aquatic species, drastically reducing the
  bird population in the region. Without <italic>acociles</italic> the
  river has been left without natural regulation to the growth of
  watercress, which has now become a kind of weed accumulated in large
  quantities that even reduce the flow of the river, affecting the
  irrigation of hundreds of hectares of the lower zone of Cuautla. For
  this reason, the Asociación de Usuarios del Río Cuautla, Manantiales y
  Corrientes, Tributarias General Eufemio Zapata Salazar A.C. (ASURCO)
  has proposed for several years to destroy watercress plantations. From
  the near extinction of the <italic>acociles</italic> among many other
  species, to the social conflicts over water, we only gather that Man
  satisfies his needs and desires by destroying whatever He assumes to
  be his environment. A destructive-extractive behavior that is, in the
  end, symptomatic of ‘the (male) reduction of the world’ to a sense of
  ownership, the world reduced to a ‘for us’.</p>

  <p>2019 was the year designated by the UN as the International Year of
  Indigenous Languages. Yásnaya Aguilar Gil gave a speech in her native
  tongue <italic>Ayuujk/Mixe</italic> on that year to the Mexican
  Chamber of Deputies that was titled ‘Mexico. Water and the word.
  Mexico and its many hidden names’. She started by asking the question:
  why are languages dying? Why will half of the world's linguistic
  diversity disappear within 100 years
  (<xref alt="n.d.g" rid="ref-np12egpx666" ref-type="bibr">n.d.g</xref>))?
  One of her answers is that the disappearance of languages does not
  happen naturally, as a consequence of a historical process or of
  changes that occur by themselves, but is due to the violence of the
  Mexican state, and of states in general, which have exercised their
  power to erase linguistic diversity. Where might we look to get out of
  this mess and the environmental catastrophe that is looming or is
  already here and we have not fully recognised it? I am interested in
  the possibility of caring for biodiversity through language, because
  to put an end to languages is to put an end to other senses of the
  world that unfold from there. In Mexico, we are taught at school from
  an early age that water is a resource, something we can use, waste,
  consume, because it is our absolute right. This thinking has
  implications in an ontological sense; it designates a particular
  perspective that understands the environment as a series of
  replaceable and paradoxically infinite objects. If this is somehow
  reflected in languages, I wonder if some of the ideas I grew up with
  and which belong to a Zapotec heritage according to which hills,
  lightning and water are animated or have agency, offer a slightly more
  holistic view among the beings we coexist with. The reality is that I
  don’t know, and I am not interested in participating in a perspective
  that turns native experiences into folklore or exoticism. Could we,
  however, recognise that other ways of thinking about plants, about
  life, have been here for a long time? Could we learn from those
  experiences? What I can say is that there would be a change of outlook
  if, as has happened in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, animals,
  plants, mountains and bodies of water were given legal personality. Or
  as if, in Ayutla, before the 2017 conflict, water was protected by a
  series of community practices that establish different degrees of
  responsibility and reciprocity towards resources and life.</p>

  these forms of plant life make up this mountain in whose entrails the

  neighbourhoods and even in the streets, which extends to other regions
  of the state. The fiesta is one of the aims of community organisation;
  it brings together work, reciprocity, common action that leads to
  moments of enjoyment; it is in some way the product of the time
  invested in work: ‘The festival is an integral result, both of the
  creativity that emerges from work, from movement, from production, and
  of nature that provides the necessary materials, and the organisation
  that strengthens the results, which are embodied in the enjoyment of

  has been transmuted precisely because of those events that finally
  challenged the imaginary line between the two worlds, to the point of

  challenge to metaphysics in Pripyat, for they are quintessentially
  changing beings that transform the places in which they grow

  testimony are any longer figures that belong exclusively to subjects
  with the consciousness and control to say what happened. The ‘natural
  world’ has also become a historical testimony. Overcoming and even
  surpassing the capacities of consciousness itself, the encounter
  between plant time and historical time exposes a type of testimony

  since Aristotle, had been reserved only for the human species and,
  specifically, for free men), shows and evidences an <italic>ecomimetic

  2000 years of life. The question of the ecophysiological aspects that
  have favoured the survival of <italic>Dioon edule </italic>cycads on

  also the question of the material record of what a living being has
  endured in its lifetime<sup>

  it, there, where their acephalous sensitivity seems to offer a
  solution to the enigma of survival. We wonder where the imprint, the
  mark of such bodily learning, remains after living embedded in an
  environment that barely sustains them. To write that a plant organism
  has a memory is to say that it has a past – of grievances and
  hostility, for example – which it bears witness to through its
  physical extension. The cycads’ memory of survival, another form of
  accumulated temporality, is harboured and extended, above all, through
  their roots. There, in that moist, fibrous region, the links that make
  their longevity possible are woven: a deep root that anchors them to
  the nourishment of the soil and a coral-like root system that grows
  upwards along the surface. These coralloid roots are the physical site
  of symbiotic processes between blue-green algae, mycorrhizal fungi,
  and the cycads. The roots of the cycads become the vital territory of
  algae, which obtain carbohydrates in exchange for fixing nitrogen for
  the cycads, and of fungi that facilitate the absorption of water and
  nutrients from the soil. A wealth of symbiotic memory: the record of
  an intimate association that makes it possible for life to cling to
  just a fistful of land. Within the coraloid roots an ancestral pact
  between soil, plant, water, fungi, algae, and sun is recorded. A root
  structure that is a pact between entities that organised themselves to
  survive in times of catastrophe, of scarcity, of threatened
  sustenance. But also, in the community of cycads that lives on this
  mountain in Veracruz, we are witnessing a rupture.</p>

  <p>The world is becoming stranger and stranger, or is it ‘us’ who keep

  it has already happened, and we can only watch it from a distance,
  following the trail it left in its wake. In Ciudad Juárez, no one was
  aware of what was happening, of how, along with the van, the radiation
  was spreading imperceptibly through the city and had even crossed
  state and national borders. It remained that way for at least a month
  until the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico detected and
  warned about a moving radioactive source nearby. By that time, the
  radioactive material had already been converted into building material
  and was being distributed. Despite efforts by the Mexican and US
  governments to collect it, an estimated 1,000 tonnes of radioactive
  rods were never recovered. Fortunately, it was easier to locate the
  van that originally transported the medical unit to the scrap yard.
  Parked in the middle of a public road, in a residential area, where
  people were passing by or gathering and children were playing, the van
  was giving off high doses of radioactivity. In fact, the few cobalt-60
  granules that remained after the vehicle had been driven through
  several areas of the city were found on the bed of the vehicle. All
  the contaminated objects, including the van, were taken to a
  radioactive cemetery

  and all of México? What houses or buildings were erected with the tons
  of rods that could not be found? Although it was too late for panic to
  break out among the Mexican population as it did in Brazil, the fate

  <p>Apocalypse has long been televised and commercialised by Hollywood
  as a synonym of spectacular destruction. Almost always destruction
  appears within an epic narrative of war, as the result of a struggle
  of good against evil (<italic>Terminator,</italic> 1984; <italic>Mad
  Max</italic>, 1979; <italic>12 Monkeys</italic>, 1995). Some films
  present civil war as an outcome of the fall of the State in its
  function as guarantor of security, as happens in the imaginary Zombies
  (<italic>I am Legend</italic>, 2007), and thereby exalt the need to
  enter a state of exception, where some sovereign can rule with an iron
  fist to preserve order. Others present a natural disaster as the only
  thing capable of stopping and, paradoxically, destroying the logic of
  annihilation that capitalism has become. In its destructive version,
  nature appears as the only possibility of a new beginning
  (<italic>Earthquake</italic>, 1974; <italic>The Day After
  Tomorrow</italic>, 2004; <italic>Geostorm</italic>, 2017;
  <italic>Don't Look Up</italic>, 2021). Last but not least, some others
  frame the debacle of humanity through rapidly spreading incurable
  diseases, which seemed to turn real with the pandemic caused by
  COVID-19 (<italic>The Andromeda Menace</italic>, 1971;
  <italic>Children of Men</italic>, 2006; <italic>The Crazies</italic>,
  2010; <italic>Contagion</italic>, 2011). … We need to remember,
  however, that Apocalypse in itself is not just a scene of great
  destruction. In Biblical texts it works as a genre that seeks to
  transmit the word of what is to come and urges to make a responsible
  decision. It is, undoubtedly, a genre marked by the search for
  justice, rather than by the mere pleasure of viewing catastrophic
  spectacles. At any rate, we know that at present it is more plausible
  to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism … the
  problem of the permanent crisis, distended towards a telos in linear
  time, where everything that exists must be placed at the service of
  the human. This is precisely the problem that Hollywood’s apocalyptic
  imaginary does not solve and that, by contrast, Biblical apocalypse
  can help us to think in an alternative way. The image presented by
  Hollywood must be set aside in order to give way to a broader
  understanding of what destruction might mean. … In the apocalyptic
  tradition, as found in the New Testament and in other ancient
  non-biblical texts, is the announcement that a longstanding way of
  thinking and understanding has come to an end, has ceased to make
  sense. An apocalypse can, in turn, rescue that which had been despised
  and place it in a new chain of relationships, in a new reality
  organised by different constraints. The characteristic of the
  apocalyptic is that it introduces the possibility of rupture, in the
  creative sense of a new reality constructed from elements that existed
  but were reduced to their minimum expression. Many worlds ended when
  technical development was used for exploitation, and many worlds end
  when the logic of exploitation loses its capacity to persuade, paving
  the way to the emergence of a new relationship with the world in
  general and with the former waste of humanity: rivers and plants.</p>

    <p>What is ruined is ruined by the ‘passing of time’. But what is

  <p>On a closer reading of Zambrano, we can see that, while ruins imply
  the division of worlds, they are at the same time evidence of their
  indiscernibility. The ruins, insofar as they represent the encounter
  between <italic>life-death and dejection-edification</italic>, become
  the ontological site par excellence that questions and deconstructs
  the separation between the human and natural worlds. In them, the
  boundaries are blurred and confused. It is no longer clear where each
  of the realms begins and ends. It is no coincidence that Zambrano
  points to the vegetal as a necessary condition of the ruins. Faced
  with the question <italic>are ruins a natural product or, rather, a
  product of human activity</italic>? her answer is that they are
  neither, and instead, that <italic>there is no ruin without plant
  life</italic>. But what does this mean in historical terms? It is
  perhaps simpler to pose the question in reverse: what would ruins be
  if they were thought of in isolation from plant life? Zambrano goes so
  far as to warn that ‘[t]he neatly preserved ruin, isolated from life,
  acquires a monstrous character; it has lost all its significance and
  only shows neglect or worse’
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2020" rid="ref-zambrano_hombre_2020" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2020</xref>). If she had previously identified ruins as the object par
  excellence for thinking about history, it is precisely because she
  recognised in them the traces of something that <italic>was
  </italic>and that was defeated by time but that, at the same time,
  survived time as that which did <italic>not come to be</italic>. In
  other words, the ruins would be that privileged object for history
  because it is through them that ‘the perspective of time appears
  before us’
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2020" rid="ref-zambrano_hombre_2020" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2020</xref>). In the ruins, a series of temporalities is articulated
  that is not restricted only to the linear triad of
  past-present-future, but also gives form and substance to time itself
  (<italic>the past that never ceases to pass, the future that never
  was, the present that is a promise, but also a memory</italic>, and
  yet another series of conjugations that remain to be thought of). In
  short, the ruins are the opening of temporal horizons, for what they
  reveal is not only the passage of time but time itself. What is
  monstrous, in this sense, is the alienation of the ruin from the world
  from which, in the first place, it emerged as an expression of the
  life that inhabits it, and which, ultimately, constitutes it. Its
  isolation and its preservation would therefore mean the closure of its
  horizons and its vital suspension.</p>

  <p>In recent times, the Pripyat area has become a landmark for
  ‘nuclear tourism’. There, one can find everything from spectators
  seeking to satiate their curiosity with a front-row view of a
  post-apocalyptic scenario to sobering tours instructing us about the
  scope and the risks of nuclear technology. While surfing the internet,
  it is not uncommon to come across those who promote the now iconic
  frozen Ferris wheel as a favourite place to take a souvenir photo, as
  well as those who offer the possibility of renting a dosimeter that
  ‘will become another organ of your senses’ so that you do not miss the
  opportunity to perceive the invisible radioactive landscape. Now that
  Chernobyl has been declared an ‘official tourist attraction’,
  permission has even been given to visit some areas of reactor 4
  (<xref alt="n.d.h" rid="ref-n3bxvl6igta" ref-type="bibr">n.d.h</xref>).
  Knowing this, some companies offer the opportunity to press the AZ-5
  button in the control room (the button that, it seems, triggered the
  1986 explosion). The <italic>museification</italic> of the world,
  perhaps best represented in Chernobyl (though not only), thus achieves
  its victory over history, which it conquers by overriding it, creating
  a knot in time (which is, at the same time, a knot between life and
  death). What the tour companies exhibit is not only the attitude of
  those who fetishise disaster, but they are the very proof of a
  reifying vision of history (inseparable, by the way, from the humanist
  figure of the author). Undoubtedly, this has become an exemplary
  scenario for understanding how the paradigm of nuclear science and
  technology provided the necessary conditions for the human being to be
  considered not only as the craftsman of the products he manufactured,
  but also as a being capable of initiating processes in the world (both
  natural and historical). Beyond the instrumental relationship that the
  human has long maintained with his environment, he has discovered
  himself to be sufficiently powerful to exert an influence on his own
  milieu and, to that extent, to be able to direct and administer it. In
  this sense, the sobering speeches accompanying and adorning the guided
  tours, which focus on raising awareness and preventing the catastrophe
  from happening again (which, moreover, have been shown to be
  ineffective) actually conceal a much more conceited meaning than it
  appears. ‘Man made this’ is the accusation that always echoes in the
  background of nuclear tourism offers. But it is not clear whether this
  accusation does indeed point to the perpetrator of the crimes or,
  rather, seeks to name the author of history; it is no longer clear
  whether what is presented here is a denunciation of the crime or an
  ode to the criminal.</p>

  <p>We drive back along the coastal road. In April last year, on this
  same road that leads to La Mancha, Adán Vélez Lira, a defender of this
  land and opponent of the mine, was murdered. When I was a child,
  getting to my grandparents' house in Boca de Ovejas meant skirting the
  hills and lagoons on a narrow road that went all the way to Poza Rica.
  Now, in its place, there is a highway all the way to Laguna Verde. We
  stop to look at the dried-up lagoon and the highway which seems to
  float above a kind of desert. Not far away, we can see the mountains
  where the mine is located. I try to imagine the perimeters that
  delimit the extent of the impacts of these projects. Like the
  radioactive fallout, the concrete, the toxic runoff, the water
  extraction, the murder of environmental defenders, invalidate our
  preconceived notions of causality and responsibility. I try to
  imagine, like a drift of suddenly visible radioactive particles, the
  drift of extractivism along a spatio-temporal line that is impossible
  for me to trace: moving through the phreatic surface, dispersing
  between streams and waterholes, tearing muscles and tissues, swirling
  in ever-longer periods of low water. The exact source, the origin, is
  never clear. Nor are the trajectories of the spread: it brushes and
  fractures our skin, the earth and its layers, the plants, their roots
  and leaves

  <p>by Etelvina Bernal Méndez</p>
  <p>‘We need new books more than ever, because all around us a new life
  is being born’ says a rural teacher’s voice. The images by Anaïs
  Tondeur in <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> reveal an unknown
  existence. They show the insistence of life, in spite of everything.
  Consciousness, on the other hand, does not always persist. The will to
  know may even get in the way. A lot of knowledge sometimes reveals
  nothing. The silent concert of plants reveals to us the beauty and
  monstrosity of an inheritance, the legacy to which we wake up as if
  surprised to recognise ourselves in the photograph of someone who does
  not see us with his eyes. A negative development. On the path of vital
  development, more than in the lights of consciousness, the unconscious
  operates as a factory of fine fabrics: an incessant producing machine
  of compositions, editions, mixtures … . A multiplicity of
  possibilities. Hodgepodge. Not arbitrary. Above and below, on the
  surface and in the depths, there is nothing seemingly unrelated and
  without consequences in space-time. The testimony of the stills
  graciously indicates that wisdom, at least that of plants, even in a
  zone of devastation, is not known, it is simply lived. Where does the
  search, the insistence of life in plants go? How do they behave,
  interpreting their environment in order to grow and live? The
  interpretation of the plants is testimony to their relationship with
  the other, the environment, the milieu, the habitat, their home. Their
  relationship with their environment, their necessary link, never
  suspended. They react to what is there, they relate to it, and not to
  something else, not to a hereafter. They simply respond to it, to what
  is there: be it fertiliser or poison, be it propitious or the
  opposite. They live or die, they adapt, fork, twist, change, modify
  their path, seek the necessary moisture, seek to insist, to overcome.
  They do not take death for granted in the face of catastrophe, nor do
  they so easily concede their return to the land from which they have
  always departed towards the sun in search of warmth. We need each
  other in our mutual differences. Our human life depends on them, our
  differences and similarities between plants, other animals, the earth,
  the water, the sun, the air ... all these differences are truths so
  clear, so evident, so certain, that perversion has only been able to
  take place in the invisibility of this interdependence, in its denial.
  There is a knowledge of the continuity between one and the other that
  is necessarily produced in the experience of the encounter with the
  world. World and life. We need each other, we depend on each other, we
  are subjects. Not only to nature, but also to representation, and to
  the signifier and to what, in spite of everything, cannot be said, the
  truth. We are finite but we are born indebted to a past and we must
  give way, pass and tribute to the future. We are beings of
  passage.</p>

  <p>In the process of re-writing, many voices intervene. Re-writing
  aims to dilute individual authorship as a whole, to question the
  notion that what we say, write or do has arisen only as a consequence
  of a solitary process. <italic>In Los muertos indóciles:
  necroescrituras y desapropiación</italic>, the writer Cristina Rivera
  Garza describes some mechanisms to make it evident that the notion of
  authorship has other possibilities of being, and that in writing, we
  are writing with many hands.I think the way in which the
  <italic>Herbarium</italic> is articulated relates different layers of
  the same reality, even different temporalities, materialities and
  imaginations. Memory is something similar. Re-writing this text from
  Oaxaca means thinking about it in a specific context, in a territory
  that has particular problems but also offers a series of responses
  that in this case are stated from a community perspective. When I
  began to think about how I could write a <italic>Herbarium</italic> in
  Oaxaca, and following Gabriela Méndez Cota’s proposal, I made a list
  of the quelites that were part of my diet and that are in the
  traditional dishes of that region. Thinking about these dishes made me
  remember my grandmothers, remembering the recipes and the moments I
  shared with them, made me imagine how these small plants grow
  intertwined in the crops, dependent on them, on the sun, the rain and
  the lightning, and at the same time autonomous. Language and food are
  maternal transmissions; it is women who communicate in different ways
  what they know and feel about the world. In ‘Mujeres indígenas, fiesta
  y participación política,’ Yásnaya Aguilar highlights the role of
  women in the community organisation of Ayutla, from the kitchen to the
  management of the fiesta and public posts. For her, the hearth is an
  affective centre for the transmission of knowledge, participation and
  social amalgamation. It is in this fire, through foods such as
  quelites and plants in general, that the network that we inhabit
  becomes evident, the set of elements that make us belong to the land,
  live off it, accompany us and enjoy time as a community of plants

  <p>From the road we can see a portion of the mine and Laguna Verde
  through its territorial impacts on the system of mountains and sister
  lagoons along the coast. We can imagine that rain falls over the dunes
  and mangroves and infiltrates the surface until it is incorporated
  into each water-body-territory. We can distinguish a glow in each
  organism and piece of land affected by the drift of extractivism: the
  uncontainable gleam of the nuclear plant: the uncontainable explosion
  of the mine. But the way of thinking that separates organism and
  environment, that sees, here, an isolated cycad, even a disposable
  one, does not fully understand its extent. The cycads bear witness to
  the difficulty of containing a gradual outburst from their mountainous
  enclosure. Muted up there, the oldest organisms have been entangled
  for more than 2000 years to a mountain which in turn is entangled to
  the lagoons downstream: their intelligence consists entwining
  themselves to that which shelters them. What, then, is there of the
  plant in us, in the <bold><italic>aguaje</italic></bold>, in the
  lagoon, in Doña Rosario, in Adán? Can we become a plant in order to

  the river shows us that there is no growth without decadence and there

  decadence and, instead, they help us to think otherwise about our own

  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>If architecture and history maintained a close relationship for
  María Zambrano, it is because both shared the same task: building,
  whose main purpose was to cover the <italic>need</italic> of human
  beings to construct a milieu that was habitable for them and that
  would protect them (thus compensating for their deficiency as the only
  maladapted being in the world). But, in addition to fulfilling this
  utilitarian function, architecture and history were also –according to
  the philosopher – the means by which human beings ultimately expressed
  their longing to find an interior that would not only shelter them,
  but also remove them from the exterior and give birth to their dreams
  (thus freeing them from the imposing weight of reality)
  (<xref alt="Zambrano 2007" rid="ref-zambrano_islas_2007" ref-type="bibr">Zambrano
  2007</xref>). However, it is experience itself that has ended up
  refuting Zambrano’s thesis. If anything is clear, it is that,
  nowadays, inhabiting is irremediably accompanied by the experience of
  estrangement and a generalised sensation of imminent danger that warns
  of the continuous presence of different threats – visible or invisible
  – that lie in wait (or how else could we describe the experiences
  lived after the various nuclear disasters, the depletion and struggle
  for natural resources, global warming, the environmental crisis and,
  we might even add, the current pandemic of COVID-19? ). The Mexican
  case is, in this sense, a scenario that represents it in a radical
  way. What do these radioactive houses tell us about this interior and
  this need and longing to build that architecture and history share? In
  ‘Política sin oxígeno’, the third part of Julieta Aranda's trilogy
  <italic>Rescatando mi propio cadáver</italic>, there is an image with
  which the artist forces us to a provocative reflection on the
  <italic>interior</italic> and on <italic>life.</italic> It is about a
  snail that in its interior harbours a parasite that is consuming it,
  bringing it to the brink of its death. The image is accompanied by the
  following lines: ‘What is inside an animal that is controlled by
  another animal? Life’
  (<xref alt="Aranda 2018" rid="ref-aranda_rescatando_2018" ref-type="bibr">Aranda
  2018</xref>). When we think of radioactive houses, it is inevitable
  that the answer to the question posed by Aranda takes on more ominous
  dimensions. It is no longer a question of one life inhabiting another,
  but the opposite: a life inhabiting the interior of its death. Today,
  history and architecture (one as a reflection of the other) have built
  a subjectivity that harbours within itself the sum of violence from
  which its constructions are now erected and from which the conditions
  of its own self-destruction originate. To refer once again to the work
  of the Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, it is curious to realise that
  the era of nuclear science and the yearning to find the Higgs boson
  (the particle that, according to the <italic>Standard Model of
  particles</italic>, would serve to finally explain the origin of mass
  and, therefore, of matter) is, at the same time, the era that
  intentionally generates its own emptiness: We burned corpses to keep
  the world turning. And it actually worked very well. The corpse energy
  made everything go faster. Life went faster, the problem is that death
  also became faster. We were digging holes all over the place, digging
  up corpses and leaving them empty. Digging up corpses was good
  business ... But in the process, we too became corpses … Meanwhile,
  under the surface … We want to know what’s inside. Inside what? Inside
  the holes, before we made them. What's left in the space the corpse
  used to occupy? And so we keep digging, to look for the inside of the
  inside, constantly getting lost along the way.</p>

  personnel watching the exclusion Zone at Chernobyl did not expect to
  encounter a mysterious companion, namely the offspring of dogs
  abandoned at the time of evacuation, with whom they have woven a daily
  bond of care that includes food, shelter, medicine and incineration at
  the time of death. Without underestimating the effects that radiation
  may have on them, coupled with the low quality of life of species that
  become feral after domestication, the presence of the dogs invites us
  to imagine another set of stories. The dogs are the living memory of
  those pets that were not killed by a military shot, and they represent
  a group of non-human refugees that link company and affection during
  the working days of the guards.</p>

  <title><bold>The unquenchable fire</bold></title>
  <p>by Fernanda Rodríguez González</p>
  <p>Radioactive fire seems to be the final victory of Promethean fire.
  Marder imagines it as that moment when nuclear energy has finally
  realised the Western fantasies of an inextinguishable biblical fire,
  the metaphysical dream of the immobile engine that moves everything,
  but which, despite its character of creative and originating
  principles, has also implied the annihilation of the created in its
  quest for the affirmation of pure form. Thus, what was initially
  understood as a definitive triumph was soon discovered to be an
  absolute defeat. Towards the end of her piece, Julieta Aranda poses a
  question that leaves no room for indifference: ‘[w]hen we reached
  maximum speed, slowness became a luxury. Are we moving faster, or has
  the world shrunk?’
  (<xref alt="n.d.i" rid="ref-n78p9o6qway" ref-type="bibr">n.d.i</xref>).
  The question undoubtedly exposes a denunciation: the gradual loss of
  the world that this technical-scientific paradigm has brought with it.
  But there is still more to add. It is not only that slowness has
  become a luxury (for a small privileged group that does not have to
  deal with the speed of these processes, or for the corpses produced by
  this same system), but it has also become a problem, as in the case of
  radioactive waste. As a result, the construction of <italic>deep
  geological repositories</italic> is the last attempt to find a place
  where we can bury the waste produced by this radioactive fire, to
  remove it from the surface and to offer us the hope of its complete
  oblivion (that it will take charge of disappearing that which we have
  not managed to get rid of, despite the fact that we are the ones who
  have produced it). But what the hope for oblivion ignores is that,
  even if we pretend that there is nothing there, that we pretend it
  never existed, oblivion can never erase the marks and traces of what
  happened, but that it always returns in one way or another to our
  present, because in reality it has never ceased to be. When Plato
  wrote the <italic>Allegory of the Cave</italic>, he never imagined
  that the day would come when the philosopher, the one who left the
  cave in search of truth, would not only no longer wish to return, but
  also would not be satisfied with his departure. His greatest desire
  now is to lock up that inextinguishable fire, bury it in the deepest
  bowels of the earth and seal the cavern in absolute oblivion.</p>

<sec id="the-dedication">
  <title>The dedication</title>
  <p>by Gabriela Méndez Cota</p>
  <p>This rewriting of <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> is
  dedicated to all those beings that have suffered as a result of the
  <italic>catastrophe of thinking</italic> that links ‘Chernobyl’ to so
  many material and symbolic places far away from Russia, Ukraine and
  Belarus. Within this, it is dedicated especially to the cycads of
  Laguna Verde, Veracruz, to the devastated rivers, volcanoes and
  crustaceans of Morelos and elsewhere in Mexico’s central valley, to
  the many languages that resist in Oaxaca and the world, to the weeds
  lining the train tracks and development projects in the Yucatan
  peninsula and the Amazon, to the mothers, friends and relatives from
  Veracruz, and from all over Mexico and Latin America, who keep
  searching for their disappeared while defending their territories and
  their own human rights. However, this rewriting also seeks to
  dislocate or open up the national, liberal humanist ways in which we
  perceive and narrate the socioenvironmental devastation that is
  occuring in Mexico. Marder writes that ‘[i]f the plants of Chernobyl
  are an afterlife of radiation, then Tondeur’s photograms are the
  afterlife of that afterlife, a variation on the theme “the copy of a
  copy” that, since Plato, has determined the outlines of the aesthetic
  domain’
  (<xref alt="M. Marder and Tondeur 2016" rid="ref-marder_chernobyl_2016" ref-type="bibr">M.
  Marder and Tondeur 2016</xref>). As an afterlife of <italic>Voices of
  Chernobyl</italic>, <italic>The Chernobyl Herbarium</italic> would
  seem to re-enact the demise of an onto-epistemology that includes
  liberal humanist authorship. Like oil-based sovereignty, liberal
  humanist authorship appears to linger and merge with the latest market
  discourse, as if its removal threatened to shatter the more
  fundamental illusion of Knowledge that has always sustained the
  borders of educational institutions and nation-states. While it is
  great to have ‘us’, non-Anglo people, students, early career
  researchers, queer, neuroatypical and differently-abled people
  communicating from their specific locations, whatever those locations
  may be and however they may be understood, it is also crucial that
  ‘we’ do so in ways that are more than simply iterations of the
  globalised bourgeois liberal humanism and its many assumptions
  regarding Knowledge
  (<xref alt="Hall 2021" rid="ref-hall_stubborn_2021" ref-type="bibr">Hall
  2021</xref>). Janneke Adema writes that ‘we need to enable a form of
  knowledge, a critique that remains open to question but that can at
  the same time be reconfigured, that can be cut and (temporally) fixed
  at some points to establish meaning and signify knowing. It is a
  knowing that, in this case goes beyond an internal subjectivity and
  includes the external lifeworld’
  (<xref alt="Adema 2021" rid="ref-adema_living_2021" ref-type="bibr">Adema
  2021</xref>). She also references Samuel Weber piracy of Kierkegaard’s
  understanding of ‘experimenting’ as an articulation of the singular,
  in order to further characterise what she has in mind as the
  introduction of ‘uncertainty, unpredictability, and ambivalence into
  our modern conception of experimentation, one that seems to go
  directly against the neoliberal rhetoric of planned outcomes, risk
  analysis, and contingency plans, all of which are designed to filter
  out the uncertain and the unpredictable’
  (<xref alt="Adema 2021" rid="ref-adema_living_2021" ref-type="bibr">Adema
  2021</xref>). This is what allows for difference in repetition, in
  repeating that we should all be communists, if only we can think a
  little outside the frame of technical calculations and property
  considerations. With Adema, we wish ‘a scholarly poetics to be a form
  of doing scholarship that pays specific attention to the relation
  between context and content, ethics and aesthetics in our research;
  between the methods and theories informing our scholarship and the
  media formats and graphic spaces we communicate with’
  (<xref alt="Adema 2021" rid="ref-adema_living_2021" ref-type="bibr">Adema
  2021</xref>). Here, we endeavoure to repeat repetition itself and
  thereby create something new; something beyond self-referential
  modernist novelty or modernist narcissistic disruption. In lieu of a
  critical analysis of Marder’s philosophy, or of a disruptive aesthetic
  intervention into ‘his’ or ‘their’ inscriptions, we offer our own
  meditations and witnessing; in lieu of artistic photograms, we offer
  vernacular images grown in the soil of Latin America’s ‘lost decade’
  as it is remembered in several Mexican cities. Since the Chernobyl
  event is indeed unthinkable and unrepresentable, what we insist on is
  the need to rewrite, reinterpret, over-interpret, or disappropriate
  its countless afterlives. The fragments we offer could be described as
  <italic>the infinite afterlives of a herbarium</italic>. Such is our
  way of taking stock of the fragmentary event of subjectivity, as the
  condition of possibility of another, more environmentally attuned, way
  of living. </p>
