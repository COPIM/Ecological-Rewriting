# About this book

*Ecological Rewriting: Situated Engagements with The Chernobyl
Herbarium* is published as part of the *Combinatorial Books: Gathering
Flowers* Pilot Project in the context of COPIM's Experimental Publishing
and Reuse working group. More information about the making of this book
can be found in our documentation blogposts collected here:
<https://copim.pubpub.org/wp6---combinatorial-books>.

[**COPIM**](https://www.copim.ac.uk "null") (Community-led Open
Publication Infrastructures for Monographs) was a 3.5-year project led
by Coventry University as part of an international partnership of
researchers, universities, librarians, open access (OA) book publishers
and infrastructure providers and was funded by The Research England
Development Fund and Arcadia -- a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and
Peter Baldwin. COPIM has been building community-owned, open systems and
infrastructures to enable OA book publishing to flourish, delivering
significant improvements in the infrastructures used by OA book
publishers and those publishers transitioning to OA. The project
addressed the key technological, structural, and organisational hurdles
-- around funding, production, dissemination, discovery, reuse,
and archiving -- that are standing in the way of the wider adoption and
impact of OA books. COPIM has been realigning OA book publishing
away from competing commercial service providers to a more horizontal
and cooperative knowledge-sharing approach.

**COPIM's **[**Experimental Publishing and Reuse Work
Package**](https://www.copim.ac.uk/work-package/wp6/ "null") (WP6) has
brought together publishers, technologists, researchers, and authors to
devise strategies to promote experimental book publishing and the reuse
of, and engagement with, open access books. We have been examining ways
to align existing open source software, tools, workflows and
infrastructures for experimental publishing with the workflow of open
access book publishers. To do so, we have been co-developing a set of
pilot experimental academic books together with the scholar-led presses
Open Humanities Press, Mattering Press, and Open Book Publishers which
have been developed with the aid of these open source tools and
technologies. We have also published research reports and have developed
online resources for authors and publishers interested in exploring
experimental forms of publication.
